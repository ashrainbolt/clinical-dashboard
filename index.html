                            <p>“Before we go any deeper, our priority is always your safety. I’d like to ask a few direct questions to help us understand what’s happening and how to keep you safe. Is that okay?”</p>
                            <p>“Thank you for telling me. I know that’s not easy. Have you wished you were dead or that you could go to sleep and not wake up?”</p>
                            <p>“Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?”</p>
                            <p>“In the past 48 hours, have you been thinking about how you might do this?”</p>
                            <p>“In the past 48 hours, have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?”</p>
                            <p>“On a scale of 1-5, with 1 meaning you feel you can stay safe and 5 meaning you might make an attempt today, where would you place yourself right now?”</p>
                            <h3>Safety Planning Questions</h3>
                            <p>“Let's think about a safety plan together. What are some early signs you notice when things start to spiral for you?”</p>
                            <p>“What can you try on your own that sometimes helps, even a little? Maybe something creative, watching a funny video, or just wrapping up in a cozy blanket?”</p>
                            <p>“Who is someone you could reach out to if things feel too big to hold alone, even just to sit with you or check in?”</p>
                            <p>“When things get dark, what’s one thing—or one person—that reminds you there’s still a reason to hang on?”</p>
                            <h3>Closure</h3>
                            <p>“Thank you for staying with this. I know it’s not easy, and I really appreciate how honest you’ve been. You’ve done something really important by talking about this instead of holding it in.”</p>

                            <p>“Thank you for telling me. I need to ask directly: Are you having urges to hurt yourself right now?”</p>
                            <p>“When you have the urge to self-harm, is it because you want to die, or is it more about coping with intense pain or feeling numb?”</p>

                            <p>“That urge makes complete sense given everything you’re carrying. It sounds like a part of you is just trying to survive and find relief, even if it’s in a way that ends up hurting you. Let’s see if we can work with that part in a safer way.”</p>
                            <h3>Offering Alternatives</h3>
                            <p>“Sometimes our body needs a very strong sensation to release that tension. We could try something from the <a class="intervention-link" data-id="tipp-skill">TIPP skills</a>, like holding ice or splashing really cold water on your face. Would you be open to trying that?”</p>
                            <p>“Remember, urges are like waves—they build, peak, and eventually become less intense. Let’s try to ride this wave out together. You don’t have to act on it; just notice it rise and watch it start to come down. I'm here with you.”</p>

                            <p>“I need to ask for safety: Are the things you’re hearing or seeing telling you to hurt yourself or anyone else?”</p>

                            <p>“Let’s try something together to bring you into the here and now with me, okay? Can you put your feet flat on the floor? Press them down a little and just notice that sensation of the ground beneath you. You’re right here, in this moment, with me. We’re safe right now.”</p>

                            <p>“Stay with me, okay? Help is on the way. Try to stay awake and keep talking to me. I know you’re very drowsy, but just focus on my voice. You’re doing great, just hang in there.”</p>

                            <p>“You know your situation best, and I’m here to support whatever you choose to do. There are people who can help. For example, have you heard of the National Domestic Violence Hotline? They have advocates available 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233 who can help you make a safety plan or find local resources.”</p>

                            <p>“What this means is that I will write down what you told me and contact Child Protective Services. They may need to ask more questions to make sure everyone is safe. I know that might sound scary, but my goal and their goal is protection.”</p>

                            <p>“I want to be very clear: What happened is not your fault. You did not deserve that. The blame is 100% on the person who hurt you.”</p>

                            <p>“I want you to have control over what happens next. If you want help reporting it or getting medical care, I can help with that. If you just wanted to tell someone and not take further action right now, that’s okay too. Whatever you want to do, I’m here to support it.”</p>

                            <p>“It sounds like you’re really hurt and angry about what happened. That’s completely understandable – when someone we care about does something like that, it can feel awful and infuriating.”</p>
                            <p>“Anyone would be upset in your situation. It shows how much this relationship matters to you; you wouldn’t feel this strongly if you didn’t care.”</p>

                            <p>“I know how painful conflict with someone you care about can be. We’ll let your therapist know what’s going on so they can help you navigate it, too. You’re not alone in this.”</p>

That doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you – it means you’re human and you have experiences that were touched by that topic.”</p>

                            <p>“I’m really glad you took a break and talked to me about it. That’s a healthy response to feeling overwhelmed. You honored your limits, and that’s a really good thing to do for yourself.”</p>

                            <p>“If you feel up to it, we can talk about how to address this. Would you want to speak with the person one-on-one with a mediator present, like me or your therapist? Or would you prefer to write down what you feel and share it that way?”</p>
                            <h3>Affirming Self-Advocacy</h3>
                            <p>“I’m really glad you told me how you feel. You have every right to speak up when something isn’t okay for you. We can work on a plan to make sure you feel heard.”</p>

                            <h3>Inviting Insight</h3>
                            <p>“Do you have a sense of what might be underneath the anger? Often there’s pain or fear hiding under it. If not, that's okay too. We can still work with the feeling itself.”</p>
                            <p>“To help focus your energy, we could explore the <a class="intervention-link" data-id="circles-of-control">Circles of Control</a> to see what parts of this situation you have power over.”</p>

                            <p>“Feeling a loss of control, being in pain, or not feeling heard by medical staff are all experiences that can be traumatic. Your feelings about it are completely valid.”</p>
                            <h3>Grounding in Present Safety</h3>
                            <p>“Let's take a moment to notice that you are not in the hospital right now. You are here with me, and you are safe. Can you feel your feet on the floor? That's you, grounded in the present moment.”</p>

                            <p>“Thinking about future appointments, what is one thing that might help you feel a little more in control? Maybe it’s writing down your questions beforehand, or bringing a trusted friend or family member with you as an advocate.”</p>
                            <p>“You have the right to ask questions, to get a second opinion, and to be treated with respect. Remembering that can be a source of strength.”</p>

                            <p>“It makes complete sense that you’re feeling anxious given what’s happening in the world. These are heavy times, and your feelings are a very understandable response.”</p>
                            <h3>Focusing on What You Can Control</h3>
                            <p>“Let's think about the <a class="intervention-link" data-id="circles-of-control">Circles of Control</a>. We can’t single-handedly solve these big issues, but we can control our own actions. What is one small, concrete action you could take in your own life that might help you feel a little less helpless?”</p>

                            <p>“It's easy to feel powerless, but remember that your choices matter in your own sphere. Let's commit to one small action this week—whether it's limiting news intake or engaging in a local community effort—to reclaim a sense of agency.”</p>

                            <h3>Discussing Coping</h3>
                            <p>“What helps, even a little, on the days when the pain is more manageable? Is there anything—a heating pad, a short walk, a good TV show—that gives you even a small bit of relief or comfort?”</p>
                            <p>“Sometimes practicing <a class="intervention-link" data-id="radical-acceptance">Radical Acceptance</a> of the pain, just for this moment, can reduce the suffering that comes from fighting it.”</p>

                            <p>“Sometimes, our direction becomes clearer when we focus on what we truly value in life. What’s most important to you as a person? Kindness? Creativity? Security?”</p>

                            <p>“Have you heard of the Pomodoro Technique? You work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Knowing a break is coming can make it easier to focus.”</p>

                            <p>“For bigger decisions, it helps to clarify what factors are most important to you. We can make a simple pros and cons list, or even score the options based on your values.”</p>
                            <p>“It’s also good to listen to both your head and your gut. Your gut feeling is often your subconscious pulling from past experiences. What is your gut telling you about this?”</p>

                        <h4>Temperature</h4>
                        <p>“The 'T' stands for Temperature. The quickest way to do this is to change your body temperature dramatically. If you can, try splashing very cold water on your face, or hold an ice cube in your hand for about 30 seconds. This activates a 'dive response' in your body that will naturally slow your heart rate.”</p>
                        <h4>Intense Exercise</h4>

We could do some quick jumping jacks, run in place, or do push-ups against the wall. The goal is to get your heart rate up and then let it come down.”</p>

Let's try it: Breathe in through your nose for a count of 4... and now breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of 6. Let's do that a few more times.”</p>

Then, as you breathe out, you let them go completely. Let's try with your hands: breathe in and make tight fists, squeezing hard... now breathe out and let your hands go completely limp. Notice how different that feels.”</p>

                        <p>“This is a helpful metaphor for managing your energy, especially when dealing with chronic illness, pain, or burnout. Imagine you start each day with a certain number of spoons. Each activity—showering, making breakfast, going to work, having a difficult conversation—costs one or more spoons.”</p>
                        <p>“Healthy people might have what feels like an unlimited supply of spoons, but for you, the number is limited. The goal isn't to force yourself to have more spoons, but to be mindful of how you spend the ones you have. It helps explain why on some days you can do more than others, and why it's so important to rest to get your spoons back.”</p>

                        <p>“A helpful way to understand trauma responses is to think of ourselves as having different 'parts.' There's the part that goes on with daily life, trying to function and seem 'normal.' Then, there can be emotional parts that hold the feelings from difficult past experiences—like fear, shame, or anger.”</p>
                        <p>“When you get triggered, it's often one of these emotional parts getting activated and taking over. The goal isn't to get rid of these parts, but to understand them, listen to their story with compassion, and help them feel safe in the present. Your adult self can learn to be a caring parent to these younger, hurting parts.”</p>
