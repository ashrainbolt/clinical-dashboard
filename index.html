"Before we go any deeper, our priority is always your safety. I’d like to ask a few questions that help us understand how you’re doing and what kind of support might help keep you safe right now."
1.  **Have you wished you were dead or that you could go to sleep and not wake up?**
2.  **Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?** (If no, go to #6)
3.  **In the past 48 hours, have you been thinking about how you might do this?**
4.  **In the past 48 hours, have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**
5.  **In the past 48 hours, have you started to work out any details for how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan?**
6.  **In the past 48 hours have you done anything to prepare to end your life?**

*If Yes to 4, 5, or 6, ask scaling questions:*
"On a scale of 1-5, one meaning you feel you can stay safe today, and five meaning that you're going to make an attempt today, where would you place yourself right now?"

### SAFETY PLAN
**Need to escalate:** "Thank you for telling me that. If it sounds like things are starting to feel more intense or harder to manage on your own, I’d like to connect you with a Crisis Manager..."
**Warning Signs:** "What are some early signs you notice when things start to spiral?"
**Internal Coping:** "What can you try on your own that sometimes helps, even a little?"
**Social Distractions:** "Who or what helps you shift your focus?"
**People to Reach Out To:** "If things feel too big to hold alone, who could you reach out to?"
**Professional Resources:** "Do you have Charlie Health’s 24/7 crisis line saved in your phone?"
**Safety at Home:** "Is there anything nearby that might feel unsafe to have around right now?"
**Reasons to Stay:** "When things get dark, what’s something — or someone — that reminds you there’s still a reason to hang on?"`,

**Offer Alternatives (TIPP skills):** "Sometimes our body needs a very strong sensation to release that tension. We could try holding something frozen (like ice)..."
**Urge Surfing Technique:** "Remember, urges are like waves — they build, peak, and eventually become less intense."

"First, let's try to change your body temperature... go splash some cold water on your face - really let it cover your cheeks and the area under your eyes."
### I - Intense Exercise:
"If you're feeling a lot of restless, built-up energy, a very short burst of exercise - maybe 60 seconds to a couple of minutes."
### P - Paced Breathing:
"Now, let's focus on slowing your breath. We're going to make your exhale longer than your inhale."
