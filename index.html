I’d like to ask a few questions that help us understand how you’re doing and what kind of support might help keep you safe right now.\n\n1.  **Have you wished you were dead or that you could go to sleep and not wake up?**\n2.  **Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?** (If yes, ask 3, 4, 5, 6. If no, go to 6).\n3.  **In the past 48 hours, have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n4.  **In the past 48 hours, have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n5.  **In the past 48 hours, have you started to work out any details for how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan?**\n6.  **In the past 48 hours have you done anything to prepare to end your life?**\n\n*If Yes to 4, 5, or 6, ask scaling questions:*\n\n> \"On a scale of 1-5, one meaning you feel you can stay safe today, and five meaning that you're going to make an attempt today, where would you place yourself right now?\"\n\n*Reflect back answer:*\n* \"So a **four** means to me you have a plan and some intentions on acting on the plan, you just don't know when. Is that accurate?\"\n* \"A **three** means to me you have strong thoughts of wanting to die and have thought about ways you might act on it, but you don't have a specific plan. Did I get that right?\"\n* \"A **two** means to me that you have fleeting thoughts of wanting to end your life, but no plan or intention of acting on it.\"\n\n“I’m really glad you told me this.

Do you need any medical attention for that?”\n\n### Clarify Intent\n“When you self-harmed, was it because you wanted to die, or was it more about coping with pain or numbness?”\n\n### Validate & Normalize\n“That urge makes sense given what you’re carrying. A part of you is trying to survive and find relief, even if it’s doing it in a way that ends up hurting you. Let’s see if we can work with that part in a safer way.”\n\n### Offer Alternatives & Coping Strategies\n* **Intense Physical Sensations:** “Sometimes our body needs a very strong sensation to release that tension. We could try the **TIPP Skill for Rapid Distress Reduction**.”\n* **“Urge Surfing” Technique:** “Remember, urges are like waves — they build, peak, and eventually fall. Let’s try to ride this wave out together using the **Name the Urge, Challenge the Urge** technique.”\n* **Safe Physical Release:** “Would it help to rip up some paper, squeeze a stress ball, stomp your feet, or even scream into a pillow?”\n\n### Harm Reduction (If urge is overwhelming)\n"I hear that the urge feels too strong to resist completely right now. The priority is to keep you as safe as possible. Is there a way to get through this moment with less harm? For example, instead of [more severe method], could you try holding ice very tightly, or drawing on your skin with a red marker?"\n\n### Commitment to Safety\n“I know the urge is strong, but do you feel like you can stay safe tonight? Even if the urge comes back, can you promise me you’ll try these coping steps or reach out for help before doing anything to hurt yourself?”`

The idea is to create a sudden shift. If you can, go splash some cold water on your face - really let it cover your cheeks and the area under your eyes. This can help slow your heart rate down very quickly when you're agitated."\n\n### I - Intense Exercise\n"If you're feeling a lot of restless, built-up energy, a very short burst of exercise can help. Could you do some jumping jacks, run in place as fast as you can, or even just tense and release all your big muscle groups very hard and fast?"\n\n### P - Paced Breathing\n"Now, let's focus on slowing your breath. We're going to make your exhale longer than your inhale. Try breathing in deeply through your nose for 4 seconds, and then breathe out very slowly and gently through your mouth for 6 seconds."\n\n### P - Paired Muscle Relaxation\n"As you continue breathing slowly, when you breathe in, tense a group of muscles. Let's try that with your hands and arms; inhale through your nose, make tight fists. Hold that tension. Now as you exhale, slowly release the squeeze. Notice the difference."\n\n### Clinical Considerations\n* **When to Use:** Best for acute, physiological distress (panic, extreme agitation, intense urges).\n* **When to Avoid:** May not be suitable for individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., heart problems, breathing issues). Always check for medical contraindications.`

You might feel anxious, overwhelmed, angry, or panicky.

You might feel numb, empty, disconnected, or have trouble thinking. Your body might feel heavy and tired.\n\n### The Goal\nThe goal isn't to never leave the window—that's impossible. The goal is to first notice when we've left it, and then to use skills to gently guide ourselves back inside. Over time, therapy can help widen the window itself, so you can handle more without getting thrown out of it.\n\n### Intervention Insight\n* When you're hyper-aroused, use skills like the **TIPP Skill for Rapid Distress Reduction** to calm your physiology.\n* When you're hypo-aroused or just want to stay in the window, use skills like **Grounding Through Senses (5-4-3-2-1 Technique)** or **Simple Somatic Anchors**.`

This is based on Dr. Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory.\n\n1.  **Top of the Ladder (Ventral Vagal):** This is your "safe and social" state. When you're here, you feel calm, connected, and curious. You can engage with others, learn, and rest. This is the state we're in when we're inside our **The Window of Tolerance**.\n\n2.  **Middle of the Ladder (Sympathetic):** This is your "mobilized" state of fight-or-flight. When your brain detects a threat, it moves you here. Your heart races, you feel anxious, angry, or panicked. You have energy to deal with the danger.\n\n3.  **Bottom of the Ladder (Dorsal Vagal):** This is your "immobilized" or "shut down" state. If the threat is too big to fight or flee, the system slams on the brakes. You might feel numb, disconnected, hopeless, or frozen. It's a very old survival system.\n\n### Why It Matters\nUnderstanding this helps us be more compassionate with ourselves. Your state isn't a choice; it's your body's automatic response to cues of safety or danger. The goal of many regulation skills is to help your system climb back up the ladder to that "safe and social" state.\n\n### Intervention Insight\n* To move from Sympathetic (anxious) to Ventral Vagal (calm), skills like **TIPP Skill for Rapid Distress Reduction** are effective.\n* To move from Dorsal Vagal (shut down) to Ventral Vagal (calm), gentle grounding like **Simple Somatic Anchors** or **Mindful Self-Compassion: Soothing Touch** can help.`

If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.\n* **Catastrophizing:** Expecting the worst-case scenario to happen, without considering more likely outcomes.\n* **Mind Reading:** Believing you know what others are thinking, usually assuming they are thinking the worst of you.\n* **Fortune Telling:** Predicting the future negatively.\n* **Emotional Reasoning:** Assuming that because you feel something, it must be true. "I feel like an idiot, therefore I must be one."\n* **Overgeneralization:** Seeing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.\n* **"Should" Statements:** Criticizing yourself or others with "shoulds," "musts," and "oughts." This can lead to guilt and frustration.\n* **Personalization:** Blaming yourself for something you weren't entirely responsible for.\n\n### What to Do?\nJust noticing these thoughts is the first step.

They often have no clear trigger and peak within about 10 minutes. The physical symptoms (racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness) are very strong and can make people feel like they're dying or losing control.\n* **Anxiety Attacks:** "Anxiety attack" isn't an official clinical term, but people use it to describe a period of intense anxiety. It usually builds up over time in response to a specific stressor. It can last much longer than a panic attack, but the physical symptoms might be less severe.\n\n### Why it Matters\nKnowing the difference can help you understand what's happening.

Inhale and notice your lungs filling... hold it for a second... now exhale nice and slow."\n\n### Empower & Redirect\n“Your courage in acknowledging how intense this feels is really powerful.
