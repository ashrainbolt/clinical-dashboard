We can’t single-handedly solve [the big issue], but we can control small actions in our own lives.”</p><h3>Encourage Active Coping</h3><p>“Sometimes taking action, even tiny ones, can restore a sense of control. It might be donating $5 to a cause, signing a petition, or simply helping a neighbor.”</p><h3>Set Healthy Boundaries with Media</h3><p>“How much news are you consuming daily?

It’s okay to be a work in progress. Purposes can change, meanings can evolve.”</p>`},{title:"Chronic Pain or Health Challenges",content:`<h3>Acknowledge the Difficulty</h3><p>“Dealing with chronic pain (or a chronic illness) is really tough.

Few decisions are truly irreversible. If you try a path and it’s not right, you can pivot. Life is more like a zigzag than a straight line for many of us.”</p><h3>Motivation and Routine</h3><p>“Feeling aimless can sap your energy. One trick is to create a bit of routine to give structure.

Having that can provide a sense of purpose to start the day.”</p>`},{title:"Time Management and Organization",content:`<h3>Positive Frame</h3><p>“You’re looking to get more organized – that’s a great goal.

Our instincts are basically our subconscious pulling from past experiences. If something ‘feels’ off, that’s data too.”</p><h3>Accept “Good Enough”</h3><p>“Aim for a good decision, not a perfect one. Striving to be a bit more of a ‘satisficer’ (someone who looks for an option that meets their needs) can ease decision paralysis. Sometimes a decision that’s 80% great is great enough.”</p><h3>Deal with Regret Fear</h3><p>“A lot of decision angst is fear of regret.

On one hand, that drive can push you to achieve great things. On the other, it’s really exhausting and can make you avoid things for fear of not doing them perfectly.”</p><h3>Set "Good-Enough" Goals</h3><p>“Let’s practice recalibrating expectations. For a given task, ask yourself: what would ‘good enough’ look like? Not terrible, not flawless, just satisfactory. And aim for that initially.”</p><h3>Address Procrastination</h3><p>“Try the motto, ‘Done is better than perfect.’ Starting something, even if you know it’s rough, gives you material to refine.

It’s totally normal to feel anxious or unsure when you’re entering a new phase of life.”</p><h3>Honor the Past Chapter</h3><p>“One thing that can help is to properly say goodbye to the chapter you’re closing. Take some time to reflect on what the experience meant. Marking the end can make it easier to begin anew.”</p><h3>Use Old Skills in New Ways</h3><p>“Remember that even though the context is changing, you’re bringing all your accumulated skills and wisdom with you. Think about other transitions you’ve navigated in the past. What helped you then?”</p><h3>Stay Present and Patient</h3><p>“Try to take it one day at a time, and be patient with yourself. You don’t have to have everything figured out in the new situation immediately. Initial discomfort is not an indicator of failure; it’s just part of adjusting.”</p>`},{title:"Building Healthy Habits & Routines",content:`<h3>Praise Initiative</h3><p>“It’s fantastic that you want to build healthy habits. That’s a big step toward improving your day-to-day life.”</p><h3>Start Small and Specific</h3><p>“One common mistake is trying to change too much at once. It’s better to start with something so small it almost seems easy. If you want to exercise, maybe start with 10 minutes of activity each morning.”</p><h3>Habit Stacking</h3><p>“Attach a new habit to an existing one. If you want to meditate daily and you already brush your teeth every morning, you could meditate right after brushing. The established habit cues the new one.”</p><h3>Create Cues and Environment</h3><p>“Make the healthy choice the easy choice. If you want to go running in the morning, lay out your running clothes and shoes by your bed the night before. If you want to drink more water, keep a water bottle on your desk in sight.”</p>`}]},
