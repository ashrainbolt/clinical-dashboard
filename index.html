                    <p>"Before we go any deeper, <strong>our priority is always your safety</strong>. I’d like to ask a few questions that help us <strong>understand how you’re doing and what kind of support might help keep you safe right now.</strong></p>

                        <li><strong>In the past 48 hours, have you started to work out any details for how to kill yourself?</strong> Do you intend to carry out this plan?</li>

                        <li>"A three means to me you have strong thoughts of wanting to die and have thought about ways you might act on it, but you don’t have a specific plan. Did I get that right?"</li>

If it sounds like things are starting to feel more intense or harder to manage on your own, I’d like to connect you with a Crisis Manager — who can better support you and help figure out the next steps to keep you safe.”</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Warning Signs:</strong> “What are some early、再再再再再What are some early signs you notice when things start to spiral?” — Maybe isolating/ feeling numb or detached.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Coping:</strong> “What can you try on your own that sometimes helps, even a little — engaging in something creative, putting on funny animal videos or stand-up clips, taking a hot shower, organizing a small space, or wrap up in something cozy and allow yourself to rest?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Distractions:</strong> “Who or what helps you shift your focus — even briefly? A friend, a safe space, a show, a pet?”</li>
                        <li><strong>People to Reach Out To:</strong> “If things feel too big to hold alone, who could you reach out to — even just to sit with you or check in?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Resources:</strong> “Do you have Charlie Health’s 24/7 crisis line saved in your phone? If you’d like, I can text it to you right now so it’s already saved in your phone.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety at Home:</strong> “Is there anything nearby that might feel unsafe to have around right now — something we could move, lock up, or ask someone to hold onto for a while?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Reasons to Stay:</strong> “When things get dark, what’s something — or someone — that reminds you there’s still a reason to hang on?”</li>

                    <p><strong>If no immediate risk:</strong> “Let’s make sure your safety plan is saved somewhere easy to find — and I’ll send a quick update to your therapist so they’re looped in and can follow up with you.”</p>
                    <p><strong>If escalated to Crisis Manager:</strong> “They’ll take it from here, but I’ll stay until they’re with you so you’re not left alone in this.”</p>
                    <p>“You’ve done something really important by talking about this instead of holding it in. That shows strength — and you don’t have to go through this alone.”</p>

                    <h3>Direct Check-In</h3>
                    <p>“Thank you for telling me. I need to ask: Are you having urges to hurt yourself right now?”</p>
                    <p>If yes: “On a scale from 1 to 10, how strong is the urge right now, 10 being the strongest?”</p>
                    <p>“Have you acted on that urge today or recently?”</p>
                    <p>If yes: “What did you do, and how severe was it? Do you need any medical attention for that (any injury or bleeding that needs care)?”</p>
                    <h3>Clarify Intent</h3>
                    <p>“When you self-harmed, was it because you wanted to die, or was it more about coping with pain or numbness?”</p>
                    <h3>Validate & Normalize</h3>
                    <p>“It sounds like everything is feeling really intense right now. I’m really glad you’re talking about it instead of keeping it inside or acting on it alone.”</p>
                    <p>“That urge makes sense given what you’re carrying. A part of you is trying to survive and find relief, even if it’s doing it in a way that ends up hurting you. Let’s see if we can work with that part in a safer way.”</p>
                    <h3>Offer Alternatives & Coping Strategies</h3>
                    <p>Ask Their Coping: “What usually helps even a little when you feel this urge? Maybe we can try one of those things together now.”</p>
                    <p>Intense Physical Sensations (<a class="intervention-link" data-intervention="TIPP Skill">TIPP Skill</a>): “Sometimes our body needs a very strong sensation to release that tension. We could try holding something frozen (like ice), doing a wall-sit or some push-ups, or splashing really cold water on your face. If the feelings are overwhelming, an intense sensory jolt can ground you for a moment.”</p>
                    <p>If they feel numb or disconnected: “If you’re feeling really numb, we might try something stimulating: hold a strong scent under your nose (like an essential oil or even vinegar), chew a piece of something very sour or spicy, or name as many objects around you as you can as fast as possible. It might feel odd, but it can activate your senses.”</p>
                    <p>“Urge Surfing” Technique: “Remember, urges are like waves — they build, peak, and eventually fall. Let’s try to ride this wave out together. You don’t have to act on it; just notice it rise and watch it start to come down. I’m here with you through it.”</p>
                    <p>Quick Grounding Distraction: “Let’s give your brain a short break. Can you name for me five things you see in the room around you that are [pick a color]? (e.g., anything that’s blue).”</p>
                    <p>Safe Physical Release: “Sometimes doing something physical can help release the feeling safely. Would it help to rip up some paper, squeeze a stress ball, stomp your feet, or even scream into a pillow? Let’s channel that energy out without hurting yourself.”</p>
                    <h3>Reduce Access to Harm Means</h3>
                    <p>“Do you have anything nearby that you’ve thought about using to hurt yourself? Would it help if we moved those out of reach, just for now, so it’s a little harder to act on the urge?”</p>
                    <h3>Strengthen Support</h3>
                    <p>“Who or what helps you feel a bit more stable when you get like this? Is there a friend or family member you might reach out to after this, or a safe place you can go where you’re not alone?”</p>
                    <h3>Commitment to Safety</h3>
                    <p>“I know the urge is strong, but do you feel like you can stay safe tonight (or until you see your therapist next)? Even if the urge comes back, can you promise me you’ll try these coping steps or reach out for help before doing anything to hurt yourself?”</p>
                    <h3>Encourage and Affirm</h3>
                    <p>“I’m really proud of you for being open about this — it takes a lot of courage to face these urges and choose not to give in. Every time you ride the wave or use a tool instead of hurting yourself, it’s a victory. You’re showing so much strength by just staying with me and trying. You deserve to stay safe, and you’re not alone. We will get through this, one moment at a time.”</p>

                    <p>“Let’s try something together to bring you into the here and now with me, okay? For example, can you look around the room and name one thing you see that’s familiar to you?”</p>
                    <p>“Put your feet flat on the floor for me. Press them down a little and notice that sensation. Feel that? You’re right here, in this moment, with me. We’re safe right now.”</p>
                    <p>If they’re hearing voices: “I know you hear those voices, but try to also hear my voice. Focus on my voice and the sound of my words right now. We’re in this room (or on this call) together.”</p>
                    <h3>Calm Reassurance</h3>
                    <p>“You’re doing really well. I’m going to stay right here with you. The things you’re perceiving can feel real, but I want you to keep noticing the ground under your feet, the sound of my voice. We’re in the present moment.”</p>
                    <h3>Close the Loop</h3>
                    <p>“You did a great job staying with me through that. That took a lot of strength. I know it was intense, but you came back to right now, and I’m really proud of you for that. You’re safe here. If it happens again, remember you’re not alone and it will pass. We will let your therapist know about this so they can help you find ways to cope if these experiences continue.”</p>

For example, have you heard of the National Domestic Violence Hotline? They have advocates 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233 who can help you make a safety plan or find resources.

                    <p>“If you want, we can talk about what happens next or any worries you have. I can’t control what CPS or others do, but I can be here with you through the process. We can also involve your therapist; they will definitely want to support you through this as well.”</p>
                    <p>“Is there someone you feel safe with that you’d like to have with you for support after this call? I want to make sure you’re not alone if you don’t want to be.”</p>
                    <h3>Closing Reassurance</h3>
                    <p>“I know this was a big step to tell me. You were very brave to speak up. Remember: you didn’t do anything wrong by telling the truth. What’s wrong is that it happened to you (or is happening to that child), and now we have a chance to get help. You’re not alone, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure you’re safe.”</p>

                    <p>“I hear you saying you want to hurt someone. I take that very seriously, and I need to ask you a few questions to understand better, because my job is to keep everyone safe.”</p>
                    <p>“Are you talking about a specific person? Who are you thinking of harming?”</p>
                    <p>“Have you thought about how you would do it? Do you have a plan in mind?”</p>
                    <p>“Do you have access to any weapons or tools (like guns or knives) that you’ve thought about using?”</p>
                    <p>“On a scale of 1 to 10, how strong is the urge or intent to act on this right now?”</p>
                    <h3>Duty to Protect Explanation</h3>
                    <p>“Okay, I need you to know: because you’re talking about harming someone else, I have a responsibility to make sure that person (and everyone) stays safe. That may mean involving other professionals or authorities right away. I want us to work together on this if possible.”</p>
                    <h3>Offer Emergency Help</h3>
                    <p>“Do you feel like you might actually act on these thoughts soon? If you do, we should get you emergency help right now. I can call 911 to help keep you and everyone safe. Would you be willing to accept that help?”</p>
                    <p>If resistant to emergency intervention: “I understand you’re furious. I can’t let anyone get hurt, including you. I might have to notify the police or a crisis team about what you’ve told me to ensure everyone’s safety. I wanted to tell you that directly because I respect you and I want you to know what’s happening.”</p>
                    <h3>De-escalate Anger</h3>
                    <p>“I get that you’re extremely angry. That anger is telling us something important — you feel deeply hurt or wronged. I’m here to listen to that. Let’s slow this down and sit with what’s coming up, instead of letting it boil over or go numb. Tell me what’s fueling this anger so strongly.”</p>
                    <p>“No one is saying your feelings aren’t valid. You have every right to feel angry. Let’s talk about it, because acting on it violently could ruin your life as well. I don’t want that for you.”</p>
                    <p>“You’re picturing getting revenge because you’re in a lot of pain. I hear that. Hurting someone might feel like it would release that pain or justice, but it could also create more problems for you. Let’s find a way to deal with this that doesn’t destroy your life or anyone else’s.”</p>
                    <h3>Negotiate a Safety Plan</h3>
                    <p>“Can you promise me you will not act on these thoughts, at least for now, and let’s focus on what you need? I want to help you find a better way to handle this anger. Maybe we involve your therapist or someone you trust right after this, so you’re not alone with these feelings.”</p>
                    <p>“If you feel like you’re going to hurt them, please call 911 or go somewhere safe away from the person. We can let someone know to protect that person, but I’d much rather help you get through this without anyone getting hurt.”</p>
                    <h3>Follow-Up and Reporting</h3>
                    <p>“I know you might not want me to, but I will have to inform my team (and possibly the authorities) about what you told me, because I care about everyone’s safety. My hope is that this helps get you more support too, not just protect the other person.”</p>
                    <h3>Close (Supportive, not Judging)</h3>
                    <p>“I want you to know I’m not against you. In fact, I’m on your side – the part of you that doesn’t want to throw your life away on this. Thank you for being honest with me. You’re dealing with incredibly powerful feelings. We’re going to do everything we can to keep you and everyone safe. You’re not alone in this, even if you feel enraged and hurt. We’ll get you help to deal with these feelings safely.”</p>

                    <p>"Hi. I’m just checking in with you briefly. It was noticed in group that [specific observation, e.g., ‘you seemed a bit sleepy,’ or ‘it looked like you were having a hard time following the discussion’]. How are you doing right now?"</p>
                    <p>"Part of my role is to support everyone in group. It’s really important for group that everyone can be fully present and engaged. Can you tell me a bit about how you’re feeling at this moment?"</p>
                    <p><strong>Potential overdose / danger:</strong> “Based on what you’re telling me, I’m concerned for your safety. We might need to get medical help.” (Pivot to Substance Overdose scenario if needed.)</p>
                    <h3>If Client Admits Use or Impairment is Clear</h3>
                    <p>"As you know, our group policy requires members to be sober and not under the influence during sessions. This is mainly to make sure you and everyone else can participate safely and get the full benefit of the therapy."</p>
                    <p>"My main priorities right now are your immediate safety and ensuring the group remains a focused therapeutic space."</p>
                    <h3>Stating the Need to Log Off (Clear, Kind, Firm - Non-negotiable)</h3>
                    <p>"Because it appears you’re under the influence right now, and in line with the group policy for everyone’s safety and benefit, I am going to need you to log off from the group session for the rest of today."</p>
                    <p>"This isn’t a punishment, but it’s a necessary step to ensure your well-being and to maintain the group’s therapeutic environment. We need all members to be fully present and sober to participate."</p>
                    <h3>Brief Safety Assessment (Essential before log-off)</h3>
                    <p>"Before you log off for the day, my top priority is to make sure you’re going to be safe. Are you in a safe place physically right now? Is there anyone with you, or someone responsible you can contact if you start to feel unwell or need help?"</p>
                    <h3>Explain Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>“Because you were under the influence and had to step out of group, I will let your primary therapist know what happened, just so they’re in the loop and can support you. They might want to check in with you about it later and help you plan for moving forward.”</p>
                    <p>“After we hang up, is there someone who can be with you or check on you? If not, is there something safe and calming you can do for the rest of the day/night? I’d feel better knowing you’re just resting or in a safe space while this wears off.”</p>
                    <h3>Encourage Self-Compassion & Support</h3>
                    <p>“It’s easy to feel down on yourself in moments like this, but you’re not alone and you’re not the first person to use [substance]. The important thing is you’re safe. We care about you and want to help you get back on track.”</p>
                    <p>“If you’re up for it later, maybe think about what led you to use today and we can talk about better ways to handle that urge next time. But for now, just focus on taking care of yourself.”</p>
                    <h3>Close on a Positive Note</h3>
                    <p>“I’m glad we could talk even for a little bit. Make sure you get some rest, drink water, maybe eat something light when you can. You’re going to be okay. We’ll talk again soon, and your therapist will also reach out to support you. You’re not alone, okay? Take care of yourself.”</p>

                    <p>“That was a lot. You did really well slowing down just now. This is hard stuff, and you’re handling it. When you’re ready, maybe we can figure out what you need next or how I can help further.”</p>
                    <p>“I know you’re still upset, but you’re also in control right now — you’re talking to me and breathing, and that’s a big win. We’ll let your therapist know how hard this was for you today so they can support you more with it.”</p>
