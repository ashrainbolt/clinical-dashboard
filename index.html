I’d like to ask a few questions that help us understand how you’re doing and what kind of support might help keep you safe right now.\n\n1.  **Have you wished you were dead or that you could go to sleep and not wake up?**\n2.  **Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?** (If yes, ask 3, 4, 5, 6. If no, go to 6).\n3.  **In the past 48 hours, have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n4.  **In the past 48 hours, have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n5.  **In the past 48 hours, have you started to work out any details for how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan?**\n6.  **In the past 48 hours have you done anything to prepare to end your life?**\n\n*If Yes to 4, 5, or 6, ask scaling questions:*\n\n> \"On a scale of 1-5, one meaning you feel you can stay safe today, and five meaning that you're going to make an attempt today, where would you place yourself right now?\"\n\n*Reflect back answer:*\n* \"So a **four** means to me you have a plan and some intentions on acting on the plan, you just don't know when. Is that accurate?\"\n* \"A **three** means to me you have strong thoughts of wanting to die and have thought about ways you might act on it, but you don't have a specific plan. Did I get that right?\"\n* \"A **two** means to me that you have fleeting thoughts of wanting to end your life, but no plan or intention of acting on it.\"\n\n“I’m really glad you told me this. It takes a lot of strength to be this honest, and I’m here to help you figure it out.”\n\n### SAFETY PLAN\n**Need to escalate:** \"Thank you for telling me that. If it sounds like things are starting to feel more intense or harder to manage on your own, I’d like to connect you with a Crisis Manager — who can better support you and help figure out the next steps to keep you safe.\"\n\n* **Warning Signs:** “What are some early signs you notice when things start to spiral?”\n* **Internal Coping:** “What can you try on your own that sometimes helps, even a little?”\n* **Social Distractions:** “Who or what helps you shift your focus — even briefly?”\n* **People to Reach Out To:** “If things feel too big to hold alone, who could you reach out to?”\n* **Professional Resources:** “Do you have Charlie Health’s 24/7 crisis line saved in your phone?”\n* **Safety at Home:** “Is there anything nearby that might feel unsafe to have around right now?”\n* **Reasons to Stay:** “When things get dark, what’s something — or someone — that reminds you there’s still a reason to hang on?”`

I need to ask: Are you having urges to hurt yourself right now?”\n* **If yes (urge is present):** “On a scale from 1 to 10, how strong is the urge right now, 10 being the strongest?”\n* **If yes (recent self-harm action):** “What did you do, and how severe was it? Do you need any medical attention for that?”\n\n### Clarify Intent\n“When you self-harmed, was it because you wanted to die, or was it more about coping with pain or numbness?”\n\n### Validate & Normalize\n“That urge makes sense given what you’re carrying. A part of you is trying to survive and find relief, even if it’s doing it in a way that ends up hurting you. Let’s see if we can work with that part in a safer way.”\n\n### Offer Alternatives & Coping Strategies\n* **Intense Physical Sensations (**TIPP Skill for Rapid Distress Reduction**):** “Sometimes our body needs a very strong sensation to release that tension. We could try holding something frozen (like ice), doing a wall-sit or some push-ups, or splashing really cold water on your face.”\n* **“Urge Surfing” Technique (**Name the Urge, Challenge the Urge**):** “Remember, urges are like waves — they build, peak, and eventually fall. Let’s try to ride this wave out together.”\n* **Safe Physical Release:** “Would it help to rip up some paper, squeeze a stress ball, stomp your feet, or even scream into a pillow?”\n\n### Commitment to Safety\n“I know the urge is strong, but do you feel like you can stay safe tonight? Even if the urge comes back, can you promise me you’ll try these coping steps or reach out for help before doing anything to hurt yourself?”`

We're going to make your exhale longer than your inhale.
