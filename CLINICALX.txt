Distress
________________
Boundary Setting
* I see you requested a CC, I’m wondering what you are looking for with our connection.


* I want to pause you for just a sec– I hear how heavy this is, and I also want to make sure we use our 20 minutes in a way that help you feel steadier, not more overwhelmed. 


* "My role here is a bit different from a therapist’s. I’m not here to do a deep dive or give you formal therapy right now — I’m here to check on your safety and help you feel a little steadier before you head back to group."

* "I hear that you want to get into everything that’s going on, but we only have a short time together. I can’t explore it all deeply here, so let’s focus on helping you stabilize in this moment."

* "Let's slow this down. My job is to support you briefly — to check on your safety and help you reset — not to unpack everything you're dealing with. We can use these few minutes to get you grounded and safer right now."
________________
Stabilize
-1: Validate & Contain
   * 1: “You’ve been dealing with a lot, and your mind and body are hitting a limit. That’s okay. There’s no rush to fix anything right now. We’re not trying to isn't to erase that heaviness — but to hold it in a way that feels manageable enough for this moment."

   * 2: "We won't dive deeper into this right now because I want to make sure you don’t leave this space feeling worse. Let’s focus on what you need most in this moment to feel a little more steady."

   * 3: "You don't owe any explanation. Sometimes clarity isn't accessible when emotions run this high, and it's completely valid to feel uncertain. "
   * It sounds like your mind’s spinning fast rn and there’s a lot of fear showing up. Let’s slow this down and find one thing we can do to help you feel more grounded during the time we have together. 

-2: Slow Nervous System
      * 1: "Let’s take a moment to slow things down together. There’s no rush here and no pressure to fix anything. 
      * Let's try one slow breath together. Inhale and notice your lungs filling... hold it for a second... now exhale nice and slow. We'll do it a couple of times, just like that."


         * 2: "Right now, our only goal is gently bringing your nervous system back to the present — not to erase these feelings, but to create enough space to breathe around them.

-4: Empower & Redirect
            * 1: "Your courage in acknowledging how intense this feels is really powerful. Remember, our goal isn’t to solve everything right now — it’s just to get you steady enough that you can leave here feeling a bit more centered."

            * 2: "You don’t have to figure all of this out today. If we can help you feel steady enough to move forward from this moment, that’s progress. We can always address the rest another time."

            * 3: "Before we wrap up, let's think of one small act of self-compassion you could offer yourself today. Maybe a short walk, sitting somewhere quiet, or just giving yourself permission to feel whatever you feel without judgment. Even a tiny act of kindness toward yourself can help you regain a sense of control."

Top Interventions
TIPP (Rapid Distress Reduction)
               * "Sometimes the body just needs a jolt to interrupt the overwhelm. Let’s try a quick temperature shock: we could splash a bit of cold water on your face or hold this cold bottle against your skin. That sudden sensation might help your system reset just enough."

               * "Let’s use your body to help calm things down. Try clenching all your muscles tight for a few seconds — squeeze your fists, arms, even your legs — and then release. We’ll do it together. That kind of full-body tension and release can let out some of the intensity you’re feeling."



Defusion (Unhooking from Unhelpful Thoughts)
                  * "Let’s try something with that painful thought that keeps popping up. Say to yourself, ‘I’m noticing that I’m having the thought that ______,’ and fill in the blank with the thought. It might sound awkward, but putting ‘I’m having the thought that…’ in front of the idea can give you a bit of distance from it."

                  * "I know it sounds funny, but you might try thanking your mind for that thought. Like, ‘Thanks mind, for trying to protect me,’ even if the thought is really negative. Sometimes a little mental nod or even a humorous ‘thanks’ can make the thought feel less powerful."

Self-Compassion

                     * "Think about what you would say to a close friend if they were feeling exactly what you’re feeling. You deserve that same kindness. What if you tried talking to yourself in that gentle way, maybe saying something like ‘It’s okay to feel this. I’m here for you.’? It might feel odd, but you really do deserve the same compassion you’d give to someone you care about."

                     * "Let’s find a small way you can be kind to yourself in this moment. It could be as simple as taking a slow breath and saying, ‘I’m doing my best, and that’s enough right now.’ You’ve been through a lot, and offering yourself even a little kindness can help ease some of the weight you’re feeling."

“Before you go back to group, I do have a brief survey that I’m required to provide. It's very short, just a thumbs up or thumbs down. Do you see the link in the chat?”
“Great! Let me know when you are done and then I will get you back into group.”
Heavy
                        * "You’re still carrying a lot — I see that. We haven’t solved everything, and we’re not supposed to in these few minutes. I just want to make sure that what you’re feeling now is something you can handle for now. Does it feel safe enough for you to wrap up, even if it’s still heavy?"

Distress
                           * " I don’t want to send you back in this state. Why don’t we take another minute here? We can try another grounding technique or even get additional support if you need it. My priority is that you leave feeling safe enough. How are you feeling about continuing a bit longer until this eases?"

🚩 Suicidal Ideation – Safety Assessment
ASSESS
"Before we go any deeper, our priority is always your safety. I’d like to ask a few questions that help us understand how you’re doing and what kind of support might help keep you safe right now.
#1: Have you wished you were dead or that you could go to sleep and not wake up?
 
#2: Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?
 	﻿﻿Yes, ask questions 3, 4, 5, and 6
   ﻿﻿No, go directly to question 6.
 
#3: In the past 48 hours, have you been thinking about how you might do this?
 
#4: In the past 48 hours, have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?
 
#5:  In the past 48 hours, have you started to work out any details for how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan?
 
﻿﻿Question #6: In the past 48 hours have you done anything to prepare to end your life?
 
* If Yes to 4, 5, or 6?  Ask scaling questions:
 
"On a scale of 1-5, one meaning you feel you can stay safe today, and five meaning that you're going to make an attempt today, where would you place yourself right now?"
 
*Reflect back answer and what that means to you.
 
◦        	﻿﻿"So a four means to me you have a plan and some intentions on acting on the plan, you just don't know when. Is that accurate?"
◦        	﻿﻿"A three means to me you have strong thoughts of wanting to die and have thought about ways you might act on it, but you don't have a specific plan. Did I get that right?"
◦        	﻿﻿"A two means to me that you have fleeting thoughts of wanting to end your life, but no plan or intention of acting on it."
 
“I’m really glad you told me this. It takes a lot of strength to be this honest, and I’m here to help you figure it out.”
SAFETY PLAN
**Need to escalate:	“Thank you for telling me that. If it sounds like things are starting to feel more intense or harder to manage on your own, I’d like to connect you with a Crisis Manager — who can better support you and help figure out the next steps to keep you safe.
Warning Signs
“What are some early signs you notice when things start to spiral?” — Maybe isolating/ feeling numb or detached/ 
Internal Coping
“What can you try on your own that sometimes helps, even a little — engaging in something creative, putting on funny animal videos or stand-up clips, taking a hot shower, organizing a small space, or wrap up in something cozy and allow yourself to rest?”
Social Distractions
“Who or what helps you shift your focus — even briefly? A friend, a safe space, a show, a pet?”
People to Reach Out To
“If things feel too big to hold alone, who could you reach out to — even just to sit with you or check in?”
Professional Resources
“Do you have Charlie Health’s 24/7 crisis line saved in your phone? If you’d like, I can text it to you right now so it’s already saved in your phone.” — even if you never use it, just knowing it’s there can make a difference in the moment.
Safety at Home
“Is there anything nearby that might feel unsafe to have around right now — something we could move, lock up, or ask someone to hold onto for a while?”
Reasons to Stay
“When things get dark, what’s something — or someone — that reminds you there’s still a reason to hang on?” — maybe someone you care about, something you’re looking forward to, or even a part of you that’s still hopeful things can get better?

Closure & Follow-Up
“Thank you for staying with this. I know it’s not easy, and I really appreciate how honest you’ve been.”
If no immediate risk:
“Let’s make sure your safety plan is saved somewhere easy to find — and I’ll send a quick update to your therapist so they’re looped in and can follow up with you.”
If escalated to Crisis Manager:
“They’ll take it from here, but I’ll stay until they’re with you so you’re not left alone in this.”
“You’ve done something really important by talking about this instead of holding it in. That shows strength — and you don’t have to go through this alone.”

🚩 Self-Harm Urges (Non-Suicidal Self-Injury)
(Client has current or recent urges to self-harm, like cutting or burning, without the intent to die. Focus on reducing emotional overwhelm, finding alternatives, and securing a safety commitment.)
Direct Check-In
“Thank you for telling me. I need to ask: Are you having urges to hurt yourself right now?”
If yes (urge is present)
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how strong is the urge right now, 10 being the strongest?”
“Have you acted on that urge today or recently?”
If yes (recent self-harm action)
“What did you do, and how severe was it? Do you need any medical attention for that (any injury or bleeding that needs care)?”
Clarify Intent
“When you self-harmed, was it because you wanted to die, or was it more about coping with pain or numbness?”
Validate & Normalize
“It sounds like everything is feeling really intense right now. I’m really glad you’re talking about it instead of keeping it inside or acting on it alone.”
“That urge makes sense given what you’re carrying. A part of you is trying to survive and find relief, even if it’s doing it in a way that ends up hurting you. Let’s see if we can work with that part in a safer way.”
Offer Alternatives & Coping Strategies
Ask Their Coping:“What usually helps even a little when you feel this urge? Maybe we can try one of those things together now.”
Intense Physical Sensations (TIPP skills):“Sometimes our body needs a very strong sensation to release that tension. We could try holding something frozen (like ice), doing a wall-sit or some push-ups, or splashing really cold water on your face. If the feelings are overwhelming, an intense sensory jolt can ground you for a moment.”
If they feel numb or disconnected:“If you’re feeling really numb, we might try something stimulating: hold a strong scent under your nose (like an essential oil or even vinegar), chew a piece of something very sour or spicy, or name as many objects around you as you can as fast as possible. It might feel odd, but it can activate your senses.”
“Urge Surfing” Technique:“Remember, urges are like waves — they build, peak, and eventually fall. Let’s try to ride this wave out together. You don’t have to act on it; just notice it rise and watch it start to come down. I’m here with you through it.”
Quick Grounding Distraction:“Let’s give your brain a short break. Can you name for me five things you see in the room around you that are [pick a color]? (e.g., anything that’s blue).”
Safe Physical Release:“Sometimes doing something physical can help release the feeling safely. Would it help to rip up some paper, squeeze a stress ball, stomp your feet, or even scream into a pillow? Let’s channel that energy out without hurting yourself.”
Reduce Access to Harm Means
“Do you have anything nearby that you’ve thought about using to hurt yourself? Would it help if we moved those out of reach, just for now, so it’s a little harder to act on the urge?”
Strengthen Support
“Who or what helps you feel a bit more stable when you get like this? Is there a friend or family member you might reach out to after this, or a safe place you can go where you’re not alone?”
Commitment to Safety
“I know the urge is strong, but do you feel like you can stay safe tonight (or until you see your therapist next)? Even if the urge comes back, can you promise me you’ll try these coping steps or reach out for help before doing anything to hurt yourself?”
Encourage and Affirm
“I’m really proud of you for being open about this — it takes a lot of courage to face these urges and choose not to give in. Every time you ride the wave or use a tool instead of hurting yourself, it’s a victory. You’re showing so much strength by just staying with me and trying. You deserve to stay safe, and you’re not alone. We will get through this, one moment at a time.”

🚩 Hallucinations or Disturbing Perceptual Experiences
(Client reports seeing/hearing things that aren’t there, or experiencing acute disorientation/delusions. Focus on ensuring safety and re-orienting to reality without directly challenging content.)
Acknowledge Experience (Don’t Dismiss)
“Thank you for telling me. I can imagine this feels really intense and scary. I want you to know I’m here with you, and I believe that you’re experiencing this.”
Safety Check (Calm & Direct)
“Are the things you’re hearing or seeing telling you to hurt yourself or anyone else?”
“Do you feel safe in your body and environment right now?”
“Are you able to recognize that what you’re experiencing might be a hallucination, or does it feel completely real to you?”
Orient to Present (Ground in Shared Reality)
“Let’s try something together to bring you into the here and now with me, okay? For example, can you look around the room and name one thing you see that’s familiar to you?”
“Put your feet flat on the floor for me. Press them down a little and notice that sensation. Feel that? You’re right here, in this moment, with me. We’re safe right now.”
If they’re hearing voices
“I know you hear those voices, but try to also hear my voice. Focus on my voice and the sound of my words right now. We’re in this room (or on this call) together.”
Calm Reassurance
“You’re doing really well. I’m going to stay right here with you. The things you’re perceiving can feel real, but I want you to keep noticing the ground under your feet, the sound of my voice. We’re in the present moment.”
Close the Loop
“You did a great job staying with me through that. That took a lot of strength. I know it was intense, but you came back to right now, and I’m really proud of you for that. You’re safe here. If it happens again, remember you’re not alone and it will pass. We will let your therapist know about this so they can help you find ways to cope if these experiences continue.”

🚩 Acute Medical Crisis
(Client exhibits or reports serious physical symptoms – e.g., difficulty breathing, chest pain, signs of stroke, loss of consciousness.)
Immediate Action – Take Charge
“Okay, I see/hear that something serious might be happening physically. The most important thing right now is getting you medical help immediately.”
Instruct to Call Emergency
“Are you able to call 911 (or your local emergency number) right now? Is there someone with you who can call for you?”
If they cannot call
“It sounds like you can’t call on your own. I’m going to get you help. Do I have your permission to call 911 for you right now to get an ambulance? I’ll need to tell them where you are.”
Obtain location
“Tell me your exact address (and any apartment or room number) so the paramedics can find you quickly.”
Keep Them Engaged While Help Comes
“Help is on the way. I’m right here with you. Try to stay as calm as you can – focus on taking slow breaths with me if possible. In… and out… nice and easy.”
“If you start to feel worse or anything changes, tell me immediately. I’m staying on the line until help arrives.”
“If you can, unlock your door so the medics can get in. And if there’s a neighbor or someone nearby, let them know what’s happening if possible.”
After Emergency Arrives (Closing)
“It sounds like the paramedics are there with you now. You’re in good hands. I’m going to let you go so they can take over. I’ll make sure our team knows what happened. You’re going to get the care you need – you did the right thing. I’ll be thinking of you, and we’ll follow up as soon as we can to see how you’re doing.”

🚩 Substance Overdose or Severe Intoxication
(Client is extremely intoxicated or has taken an overdose – slurred speech, very drowsy, incoherent, etc.)
Recognize Seriousness (Calm & Clear)
“I can tell this is serious. I’m very concerned that you might be experiencing a medical emergency from substances.”
“You mentioned you took [X amount of Y]. That can be dangerous.”
Instruct to Call Emergency
“This is urgent. Are you able to call 911 right now for medical attention? Or is there someone with you who can call?”
If they cannot call
“If you can’t call, I will. I need to get you an ambulance right now. Is it okay if I call 911 for you? I’ll need your exact location and any info on what you took.”
Get essential info
“What’s the address where you are right now? And do you know exactly what substance(s) you took, about how much, and roughly when? I’ll pass that to the paramedics – it’s really important for your treatment.”
Naloxone (If Opioid Overdose suspected)
“If this might be an opioid overdose and if you or anyone there has Naloxone (Narcan) and knows how to use it, please use it now while we wait for the ambulance.”
Keep Them Awake & Oriented
“Stay with me, okay? Help is coming. Try to stay awake and keep talking to me. I know you’re very drowsy, but focus on my voice. You’re doing great, just hang in there a little longer.”
“If you can, try to take some slow breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth… good. Keep breathing.”
“Is your door unlocked for the paramedics? If you’re able to, unlock it or have someone ready to open it for them.”
After Emergency Takes Over
“The paramedics are with you now? Okay. They’re going to take care of you. I’m going to step back and let them do that. You’re in good hands. I know this is scary, but you’re getting the help you need. I’ll make sure your care team knows what happened so we can support you after this. Take care – you’re not alone and you’re going to get through this.”

🚩 Unsafe Home Environment / Domestic Violence
(Client discloses they are in an unsafe or abusive relationship or home situation.)
Express Empathy and Belief
“Thank you for sharing this with me. I can’t imagine how hard it was to say that out loud. I want you to know I believe you, and you didn’t deserve any of this.”
“It’s incredibly brave of you to talk about what’s happening at home. You’re not at fault for their behavior.”
Assess Immediate Safety
“Are you safe right now? Is the person who hurt you nearby or likely to return soon?”
“Are there children or anyone else in the home who might also be in danger right now?”
If immediate danger
“Your safety is the number one priority. If you think you’re in immediate danger, we should consider calling 911. Do you feel like you need emergency help right now to stay safe?”
Provide Control & Options
“You know your situation best, and I’m here to support whatever you choose to do. There are people who specialize in helping in situations like yours. For example, have you heard of the National Domestic Violence Hotline? They have advocates 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233 who can help you make a safety plan or find resources. We can call them together if you want, or I can give you that information to reach out when you’re ready.”
“Is there a friend or family member you trust whom you could stay with, or at least talk to, about what’s happening?”
“If you ever feel unsafe and need to leave quickly, do you have a bag with essentials and important documents prepared? We can brainstorm that if you want.”
Empower & Validate
“You are not alone and there are people who want to help. You deserve to be safe. None of this is your fault — the responsibility lies with the person hurting you.”
“Whatever you decide, I’ll support you. You’re doing the right thing by reaching out. We’ll also let your primary therapist know what you’ve shared (unless you have concerns about that) so that we can all be on the same page to help keep you safe.”
Commitment
“Until we figure out longer-term steps, can you promise me you’ll prioritize your safety? If things get dangerous, please get out and get somewhere safe if you can, and call emergency services. You’re important, and we want you alive and okay.”
Closing Assurance
“I’m really glad you told me. You didn’t deserve any of this, and you deserve support. We will do everything we can to help you be safe. You’re not alone in this.”

🚩 Child Abuse or Neglect Disclosure
(Client reveals that a minor (themselves or someone else) is being abused or neglected. Coach must ensure proper reporting.)
Respond with Care
“Thank you for telling me that. I know it’s not easy to talk about. I am so sorry this happened to you (or to that child). No one, especially no child, should have to go through that. It’s absolutely not your fault, and you didn’t deserve that.”
Explain Mandated Reporting (Transparent and Reassuring)
“I need you to know: because you shared this, I’m required by law to take steps to report it to the proper authorities so that the child can get help and be safe. This isn’t to get anyone in trouble; it’s to protect you/them and make sure it doesn’t continue. As a mandated reporter, I have to let child protection professionals know when a minor is being hurt or is in danger.”
“What this means is that I will write down what you told me and contact Child Protective Services (or the appropriate agency) after our conversation. They may need to ask more questions to make sure everyone is safe.”
“I know that might sound scary, but my goal and their goal is to keep you (or that child) safe. You are not in any trouble for telling me – in fact, you did exactly the right thing by telling someone. This is how we can get help.”
Support the Client’s Emotions
“How are you feeling now that you’ve shared that? It’s a lot, I know. Whatever you’re feeling – scared, relieved, angry – it’s completely understandable.”
“I’m here with you. You’re not alone in dealing with this anymore.”
Empower & Involve (If appropriate)
“If you want, we can talk about what happens next or any worries you have. I can’t control what CPS or others do, but I can be here with you through the process. We can also involve your therapist; they will definitely want to support you through this as well.”
“Is there someone you feel safe with that you’d like to have with you for support after this call? I want to make sure you’re not alone if you don’t want to be.”
Closing Reassurance
“I know this was a big step to tell me. You were very brave to speak up. Remember: you didn’t do anything wrong by telling the truth. What’s wrong is that it happened to you (or is happening to that child), and now we have a chance to get help. You’re not alone, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure you’re safe.”

🚩 Threat of Harm to Others (Homicidal Ideation)
(Client expresses intent or thoughts of seriously harming someone else. Coach must ensure safety of others – duty to warn – and de-escalate client’s anger.)
Immediate Clarification (Calm & Firm)
“I hear you saying you want to hurt someone. I take that very seriously, and I need to ask you a few questions to understand better, because my job is to keep everyone safe.”
“Are you talking about a specific person? Who are you thinking of harming?”
“Have you thought about how you would do it? Do you have a plan in mind?”
“Do you have access to any weapons or tools (like guns or knives) that you’ve thought about using?”
“On a scale of 1 to 10, how strong is the urge or intent to act on this right now?”
Duty to Protect Explanation
“Okay, I need you to know: because you’re talking about harming someone else, I have a responsibility to make sure that person (and everyone) stays safe. That may mean involving other professionals or authorities right away. I want us to work together on this if possible.”
Offer Emergency Help
“Do you feel like you might actually act on these thoughts soon? If you do, we should get you emergency help right now. I can call 911 to help keep you and everyone safe. Would you be willing to accept that help?”
If resistant to emergency intervention
“I understand you’re furious. I can’t let anyone get hurt, including you. I might have to notify the police or a crisis team about what you’ve told me to ensure everyone’s safety. I wanted to tell you that directly because I respect you and I want you to know what’s happening.”
De-escalate Anger
“I get that you’re extremely angry. That anger is telling us something important — you feel deeply hurt or wronged. I’m here to listen to that. Let’s slow this down and sit with what’s coming up, instead of letting it boil over or go numb. Tell me what’s fueling this anger so strongly.”
“No one is saying your feelings aren’t valid. You have every right to feel angry. Let’s talk about it, because acting on it violently could ruin your life as well. I don’t want that for you.”
“You’re picturing getting revenge because you’re in a lot of pain. I hear that. Hurting someone might feel like it would release that pain or justice, but it could also create more problems for you. Let’s find a way to deal with this that doesn’t destroy your life or anyone else’s.”
Negotiate a Safety Plan
“Can you promise me you will not act on these thoughts, at least for now, and let’s focus on what you need? I want to help you find a better way to handle this anger. Maybe we involve your therapist or someone you trust right after this, so you’re not alone with these feelings.”
“If you feel like you’re going to hurt them, please call 911 or go somewhere safe away from the person. We can let someone know to protect that person, but I’d much rather help you get through this without anyone getting hurt.”
Follow-Up and Reporting
“I know you might not want me to, but I will have to inform my team (and possibly the authorities) about what you told me, because I care about everyone’s safety. My hope is that this helps get you more support too, not just protect the other person.”
Close (Supportive, not Judging)
“I want you to know I’m not against you. In fact, I’m on your side – the part of you that doesn’t want to throw your life away on this. Thank you for being honest with me. You’re dealing with incredibly powerful feelings. We’re going to do everything we can to keep you and everyone safe. You’re not alone in this, even if you feel enraged and hurt. We’ll get you help to deal with these feelings safely.”

🚩 Under the Influence (Non-Crisis)
(Client is under the influence of drugs/alcohol but not in immediate medical danger – e.g., they logged off a group session due to intoxication. Focus on safety and next steps.)
Immediate Safety Check
"Hi. I'm just checking in with you briefly. It was noticed in group that [specific observation, e.g., 'you seemed a bit sleepy,' or 'it looked like you were having a hard time following the discussion']. How are you doing right now?"
"Part of my role is to support everyone in group. It's really important for group that everyone can be fully present and engaged. Can you tell me a bit about how you're feeling at this moment?"
****potential overdose / danger***
“Based on what you’re telling me, I’m concerned for your safety. We might need to get medical help. “
(Pivot to overdose protocol if needed.)
If Client Admits Use or Impairment is Clear:
"As you know, our group policy requires members to be sober and not under the influence during sessions. This is mainly to make sure you and everyone else can participate safely and get the full benefit of the therapy."
"My main priorities right now are your immediate safety and ensuring the group remains a focused therapeutic space."
Stating the Need to Log Off (Clear, Kind, Firm - Non-negotiable):
"Because it appears you're under the influence right now, and in line with the group policy for everyone's safety and benefit, I am going to need you to log off from the group session for the rest of today."
"This isn't a punishment, but it's a necessary step to ensure your well-being and to maintain the group's therapeutic environment. We need all members to be fully present and sober to participate."
Brief Safety Assessment (Essential before log-off): 
"Before you log off for the day, my top priority is to make sure you're going to be safe. Are you in a safe place physically right now? Is there anyone with you, or someone responsible you can contact if you start to feel unwell or need help?"
Explain Next Steps
“Because you were under the influence and had to step out of group, I will let your primary therapist know what happened, just so they’re in the loop and can support you. They might want to check in with you about it later and help you plan for moving forward.”
“After we hang up, is there someone who can be with you or check on you? If not, is there something safe and calming you can do for the rest of the day/night? I’d feel better knowing you’re just resting or in a safe space while this wears off.”
Encourage Self-Compassion & Support
“It’s easy to feel down on yourself in moments like this, but you’re not alone and you’re not the first person to use [substance]. The important thing is you’re safe. We care about you and want to help you get back on track.”
“If you’re up for it later, maybe think about what led you to use today and we can talk about better ways to handle that urge next time. But for now, just focus on taking care of yourself.”
Close on a Positive Note
“I’m glad we could talk even for a little bit. Make sure you get some rest, drink water, maybe eat something light when you can. You’re going to be okay. We’ll talk again soon, and your therapist will also reach out to support you. You’re not alone, okay? Take care of yourself.”

🟠 Orange Zone – High Distress 
(High-intensity emotional states requiring significant containment, co-regulation, and distress tolerance interventions. Client is very upset, panicked, or agitated, but not in imminent danger. Focus on de-escalation and grounding.)
🟠 Highly Agitated or Escalating
(Client is extremely distressed, perhaps loud, pacing, or visibly restless and overwhelmed.)
Center and Slow the Moment
“I can see (or hear) how agitated you are. Let’s take a pause for a second. I’m right here with you. You don’t have to go through this moment alone.”
“It’s okay to feel everything you’re feeling. I just want to help you not feel so overwhelmed by it all at once. Can we try to take one slow breath together?”
Acknowledge the Anger/Frustration
“That energy and anger you’re feeling right now — it makes sense. Something important is going on inside you and it’s demanding to be heard.”
“This anger is telling us something important. I hear that you’ve been pushed to your limit. I’m listening.”
Keep Voice Calm & Assuring
“I’m not going anywhere. I know you’re really upset, and it’s okay. Let’s stay right here. You’re safe with me to let it out, as long as we keep each other safe.”
If they are pacing or shaking
“It’s okay if you need to move. I’ll move a bit with you. Let’s walk together and breathe, no rush.”
Encourage Expression vs. Explosion
“Let’s slow this down and sit with what’s coming up, instead of letting it boil over or shutting it down. What’s the strongest thing on your mind right now? I’m here to listen.”
“You don’t have to hold back — I can handle whatever it is. Go ahead and tell me what’s going on, I’m listening.”
Validation
“Anyone in your situation would feel upset. It’s okay to feel this. We just want to keep it from hurting you or anyone else while it’s so strong.”
“You have every right to feel the way you do. Let’s channel it in a way that helps you, not hurts you.”
Grounding in Present
If they seem disoriented by emotion: “Look at me for a second and take a breath. We’re right here, in this room (or on this call). You’re doing okay. Just keep breathing. That’s it.”
After Calming Slightly – Reflection
“That was a lot. You did really well slowing down just now. This is hard stuff, and you’re handling it. When you’re ready, maybe we can figure out what you need next or how I can help further.”
“I know you’re still upset, but you’re also in control right now — you’re talking to me and breathing, and that’s a big win. We’ll let your therapist know how hard this was for you today so they can support you more with it.”

🟠 Acute Anxiety or Panic Attack
(Client is panicked – rapid breathing, fear of dying or losing control, chest tightness, etc.)
Immediate Physiological Regulation (TIPP Skills)
"Right now, your body is in fight-or-flight mode. Let's try something called TIPP to help calm your nervous system quickly."
"First, let's try Temperature. Can you splash some cold water on your face, or hold a cold water bottle or ice cube if you have one? This triggers something called the 'dive response' that naturally slows your heart rate."
[If they can't access cold, continue with breathing]
"Now let's try Paced Breathing. We're going to breathe together in a way that tells your nervous system it's safe to calm down. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts... hold for 4... now out through your mouth for 6 counts. That longer exhale is key - it activates your body's relaxation response."
[Breathe with them for several cycles]
"How does that feel? Even a small shift means your body is starting to move out of panic mode."

Grounding Through Somatic Anchors
"Let's try a simple grounding technique. Can you bring your attention to your feet on the floor? Just notice the sensation of contact, the solid ground beneath you. This quietly reminds your nervous system that you're here, right now, and you're safe in this moment."
"Now, place one hand on your heart and one on your belly. Feel the warmth of your own touch. This is your body's way of sending itself a message of comfort and safety."
"Let's try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Can you name 5 things you can see around you? ... 4 things you can touch? ... 3 things you can hear? ... 2 things you can smell? ... 1 thing you can taste? This brings your nervous system into the present moment, out of the anxious future your mind was creating."

Defusing from Anxious Thoughts
"I'm hearing some really anxious thoughts like '[repeat their specific worry].' Right now, these thoughts feel absolutely true and urgent. Let's try something - can you add this phrase: 'I'm having the anxious thought that...' So instead of 'Something terrible is going to happen,' it becomes 'I'm having the anxious thought that something terrible is going to happen.'"
"Do you notice any difference when we say it that way? Sometimes adding that phrase can help you see the thought as just a mental event - something your anxious mind is producing - rather than a prediction of reality."
"Anxiety is like a smoke alarm that's become overly sensitive. It's trying to protect you, but it's going off even when there's no real fire. Your thoughts right now are the anxiety talking, not necessarily the truth talking."

Acknowledging the Anxious Protector Part
"It sounds like there's a part of you that's working really hard to scan for danger and keep you safe. This anxious part is hypervigilant, always looking for what could go wrong. Let's get curious about this part with compassion."
"Can we ask this anxious part: 'What are you trying to protect me from? What are you afraid would happen if you stopped worrying about this?' Often our anxiety developed for good reasons - maybe to help us avoid real dangers in the past."
[Allow them to explore this]
"Can we thank this anxious part for trying to keep you safe, while also letting it know that it might be working overtime right now? Maybe we can ask it to turn down the volume just a little bit."

Reality Testing vs. Anxiety Stories
"Anxiety is a master storyteller - it creates vivid, detailed stories about all the things that could go wrong. Right now, anxiety is telling you the story that '[their specific fear].' Let's look at this story together."
"What evidence do we have that this story anxiety is telling is actually true? And what evidence do we have that contradicts it? I'm not trying to dismiss your concerns - I want us to separate what's actually happening from what anxiety is predicting might happen."
"Has anxiety told you stories like this before? How often have anxiety's worst-case scenarios actually come true? What does that tell us about how reliable anxiety is as a fortune teller?"

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Worry
"This worry, this anxiety - it's taking up a lot of your mental and emotional energy right now. Let's look at this objectively. What are the advantages of worrying about this? How does the anxiety serve you? Some people say it helps them prepare or prevents them from being caught off guard."
[Explore any perceived benefits]
"Now let's look at the costs. What is this anxiety costing you emotionally? How is it affecting your sleep, your relationships, your ability to enjoy your life? What does carrying this worry cost you?"
"Looking at both sides, is this level of worry actually helping you solve the problem or prepare for challenges, or is it just creating suffering without changing anything?"

Opposite Action for Anxiety
"Anxiety is telling you to avoid, to escape, to stay away from [specific situation/trigger]. While that urge makes complete sense, I'm wondering if avoiding is actually making the anxiety stronger over time."
"What would be the opposite of what anxiety is demanding? Instead of avoiding, what would it look like to take one small step toward [the feared situation]? We're not talking about jumping in the deep end - just moving slightly in the opposite direction of avoidance."
"Remember, we're not trying to eliminate the anxiety - we're trying to show your nervous system that you can handle feeling anxious and still take action. That's how we build confidence."

Radical Acceptance of Uncertainty
"Part of what's driving this anxiety is the need to know for certain that everything will be okay. But here's the difficult truth: we can't control or predict most of what happens in life. Fighting against uncertainty creates more suffering."
"Radical acceptance doesn't mean giving up or not caring. It means acknowledging reality: 'I cannot know for certain what will happen. I cannot control everything. This uncertainty is part of being human.'"
"What would it feel like to stop fighting against the not-knowing? To say, 'I can handle not knowing for certain. I can take the next right step even when I can't see the whole staircase.'"

Separating Anxiety from Identity
"I notice you're saying things like 'I'm just an anxious person' or 'I'm always worried.' These are identity statements. Let's reframe this: instead of 'I am anxious,' can we say 'I am experiencing anxiety right now'?"
"You are not your anxiety. You are a person who sometimes experiences anxiety. There's a big difference. Anxiety is something you're going through, not something you are."
"What parts of yourself exist when you're not anxious? What do you love, what brings you joy, what are you good at? Those parts are just as real and true as this anxious part."

Creating a Coping Plan
"Let's create a plan for the next time anxiety starts to escalate. What are the early warning signs that anxiety is building for you? Physical sensations, thoughts, or situations that tend to trigger it?"
"When you notice those early signs, what's one thing from our conversation today that you could try? Maybe the breathing technique, or the grounding with your feet, or asking yourself 'Is this anxiety talking or reality talking?'"
"Who is one person you could reach out to when anxiety gets intense? Sometimes just saying 'I'm feeling anxious right now' to someone who cares can help break the isolation that feeds anxiety."

Self-Compassion for Anxiety
"Anxiety can make you feel like you're weak or broken for feeling this way. But anxiety is not a character flaw - it's a human experience. Let's try a moment of self-compassion."
"Can you acknowledge: 'This is a moment of suffering. This anxiety is really difficult.' Then connect to our shared humanity: 'Anxiety is part of the human experience. Millions of people feel exactly what I'm feeling right now.'"
"Now, with your hand on your heart, can you offer yourself kindness: 'May I be gentle with myself. May I treat myself with the same compassion I'd show a good friend who was struggling with anxiety.'"

Future-Focused Coping
"Right now, anxiety is pulling your attention into an imagined future full of problems. Let's bring you back to what you actually have control over - this moment and the next small step."
"What's one thing you can do in the next hour that aligns with what you care about, regardless of how anxious you feel? Not to get rid of the anxiety, but to show yourself that you can carry anxiety and still live your life."
"Remember, the goal isn't to never feel anxious again - that's not realistic. The goal is to develop a different relationship with anxiety, where it doesn't control your choices."

Closing & Resource Connection
"You've shown real courage by reaching out today and working through this. That tells me something important about your strength, even when you can't feel it right now."
"Anxiety can be very isolating, but you've just proven that you don't have to face it alone. That's a powerful step."
"What's one small thing you can do to take care of yourself in the next few hours? Maybe some gentle movement, calling a friend, or practicing one of the techniques we talked about?"
“Whenever you’re ready, we’ll think about what might help you next or what usually comforts you after a panic. Maybe grabbing some water, or sitting quietly for a few minutes. I’ll let your therapist know how overwhelming this got so you two can work on more strategies for next time. But for now, just breathe and know you’re okay. You made it through.”

🟠 Overwhelmed & Emotionally Flooded
(Client is “shutting down” or crying heavily because feelings are too intense to process. Not actively panicking, but clearly drowning in emotion.)
Contain and Validate
“It’s all feeling like too much, isn’t it? I hear you. What you’re experiencing right now makes so much sense given everything you’re carrying. Anyone would feel overwhelmed in your shoes.”
“You’ve been dealing with a lot, and your mind and body are hitting a limit. That’s okay. There’s no rush to fix anything at this second. Let’s just take this moment by moment.”
Permission to Pause
“We don’t need to unpack everything right now. In fact, we shouldn’t dive deeper into anything heavy at this moment, because I want to make sure you don’t leave here feeling even worse. Let’s focus on just helping you feel a little steadier.”
If they are silent or shut down
“It’s alright if you can’t put it into words. You don’t owe me any explanation. Sometimes clarity isn’t possible when emotions run this high. It’s completely valid to feel blank or numb or like you can’t speak. I’m here with you, even in the quiet.”
“Give yourself permission not to have the answers right now. We can just sit together. That alone can make it a bit lighter.”
Grounding in Present
“Can you feel the chair under you, or your feet on the ground? Let’s start there. Just notice those physical points of contact – it might help bring you back just a little from the flood of feelings.”
“Let’s try one slow breath together. Even if everything inside is swirling, see if you can find that breath. In... and out… nice and slow.”
Supportive Reassurance
“I’m right here, and I’m not overwhelmed by your overwhelm. You don’t have to hold it together for my sake. It’s okay to let it out – cry, sit silently, whatever you need. I’ve got you.”
“You might feel like you’re drowning in feelings, but I promise you’ll float again. This wave will recede. While it’s here, we’ll just keep you afloat. Holding on is enough right now.”
When Slightly Calmer – Options
“Is there anything that usually helps even a little when you feel like this? Maybe stepping outside for a minute, getting a cold drink of water, hugging a pillow…? We can try something small to help bring you back up for air.”
“Sometimes splashing water on your face or listening to a favorite song can help when you’re feeling flooded. Would you like to try one of those or something else?”
Transition Back
“You don’t have to feel completely better right now. We just want you steady enough to move forward. Even 1% more calm than before is progress.”
“When you’re ready, we’ll rejoin the group (or continue with what we were doing), but only at the pace you’re comfortable. And I’ll touch base with your therapist to let them know it got really intense, so they can check in on this more with you. For now, just know you did exactly what you needed by taking a timeout. I’m proud of you for that.”

🟠 Unusual Thoughts (Mild Paranoia or Cognitive Distortions)
(Client is having odd or paranoid thoughts but still in contact with reality – e.g., “I feel like everyone in group secretly hates me,” or mild conspiratorial thinking. Not full hallucinations, but distorted thinking.)
Do Not Dismiss or Mock
“That sounds really troubling. It must feel scary (or confusing) thinking that might be true. Thank you for telling me what’s going through your mind.”
Gently Reality-Check
“Let’s look at that together. You feel like everyone in group hates you. I know it can really feel that way. May I share what I’ve observed? I’ve seen group members show you care – like when you spoke last week, two people literally said they related and appreciated you. I’m not seeing evidence of hate. I know feelings can be super convincing, though.”
“When our mind is stressed, it can tell us stories that feel true even if they aren’t. It doesn’t mean you’re ‘crazy’; it means you’re trying to make sense of fear.”
Reinforce Safety/Trust
“I want you to know, I don’t hate you. I’m actually really glad you’re here and talking to me. You’re not doing anything wrong by sharing this.”
“Is it okay if we test those thoughts a bit? For example, what evidence do we have that everyone hates you? And what evidence might there be that they don’t? We can play detective together, no pressure.”
Encourage Open Mind
“Sometimes when we feel targeted or unsafe, our brain is working overtime to protect us, even if it misreads things. Maybe we can consider other explanations. For instance, could it be that people in group were quiet not because they hate you, but because they were thinking about what you said or dealing with their own feelings?”
Ground in Present
“Let’s take a breath and look at one concrete thing right now: You and I talking. I’m here with you, and I care about what you’re saying. That’s real, right? Focus on this interaction; how does it feel? Safe? Trusting? If yes, hold onto that feeling as evidence that not everyone is against you.”
Plan
“What would help you feel safer or less worried in group? Maybe sitting near the exit, or having a signal with me if you start feeling paranoid so we can step out? We can make a plan so those thoughts don’t overwhelm you next time.”
“Also, I’ll mention this to your therapist. Maybe there are some strategies or even a med adjustment that can help with these thoughts. You’re not alone in dealing with this.”
Affirm
“You’re not ‘crazy’ or bad for having these thoughts. Our minds do all kinds of weird things under stress. The fact that you can question it and talk about it means you have insight and courage. We’ll keep an eye on it together.”

🟠 Trauma Reaction / Flashback
(Client experiences a sudden trauma memory or flashback – they might appear frightened, distant, or like they’re reliving something.)
Ground in Present Safety
“Hey, you’re here with me. You’re safe right now. It looks like you’re remembering something really scary, but I want you to try to notice the room we’re in (or the fact that you’re on the phone with me). That thing isn’t happening to you right this second, even though it feels like it is.”
“Let’s use your senses to ground you firmly in the present. Can you feel the floor under your feet? Press them down a little... good. Can you look around and name one thing you see in this room?”
“I know that was overwhelming. You’re doing great. Keep focusing on what’s around you here and now: the color of the walls, the sound of my voice, the temperature of the air... All of that is real in this moment.”
Breathe and Orient
“Take a deep breath if you can. You’re breathing in 2025. You’re [client’s name], and you’re here with me, not back in that situation. That was then, and this is now. Can you say out loud, ‘I’m here now’?”
If they can speak
“Good, keep talking to me. What day is it today? Do you know where you are? Excellent. Keep describing things you see.”
Validate and Contain
“That memory was really intense. It makes sense that it felt like it was happening all over again. Flashbacks can be that powerful. But it’s not happening now, and you survived it then. You’re safe now.”
“It’s completely natural that your body reacted like that. It’s your brain’s way of trying to protect you from something it remembers. It doesn’t realize time has passed.”
Aftercare Suggestions
“Coming out of a flashback can leave you shaken. Is there something that usually helps you feel comforted after that happens? Maybe wrapping in a blanket, holding a soft object, or stepping outside for some fresh air? Let’s do that together if you’d like.”
“We can take a few minutes or as long as you need. There’s no rush to jump back in. You might feel tired or on edge – that’s okay. We’ll just let you catch your breath.”
Empowerment
“You did really well. You rode that out and came back. That takes a lot of strength. That was hard work, and you did it. You’re safe and you’re here. You’re not alone – I’m here and I heard you.”
“If you want, later we can talk about what might help if a flashback happens again. For now, we’ll just stay in the present. I’ll let your therapist know this happened so they can help you process it in session, if you’re okay with that.”

🟠 Sexual Assault Disclosure (Trauma Processing in the Moment)
(Client reveals they have been sexually assaulted (recently or in the past) and is in high emotional distress about it. No immediate medical emergency, but high emotional turmoil.)
Listen and Honor their Courage
“I’m so sorry that happened to you. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me. I can’t imagine how terrible that was for you, and how heavy it must be to carry that.”
“What happened is not your fault. You did not deserve that. The blame is 100% on the person who hurt you.”
Validate the Response
“Anyone who went through what you did would be feeling a lot right now. It makes sense to feel violated, angry, scared, numb, or however you’re feeling. There’s no right or wrong way to react.”
“Your reactions – the nightmares, the fear, even any self-blame – are common trauma responses. You’re not alone in those feelings, and they don’t change the fact that the person responsible is the perpetrator, not you.”
Ensure Present Safety (if recent assault)
“Are you currently safe from that person? They’re not around now, right?”
“If this was recent and you feel up to it, we can talk about medical care or evidence collection, but that’s entirely your choice. Right now, my main concern is your emotional safety.”
Empower Choices
“I want you to have control over what happens next. If you want help reporting it or getting medical care, I can help facilitate that. If you just wanted to tell someone and not take further action right now, that’s okay too. Whatever you want to do, I’m here to support it.”
“There are resources specifically for this, like the Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-4673). They have counselors who get it, and you can call anytime. We can call together if you want, now or in the future.”
Ground in the Moment
If client is dissociating or panicking while discussing: “Let’s pause for a second and take a deep breath. You’re safe here with me. Feel the couch beneath you or the phone in your hand. You’re in a safe place right now.”
After Disclosure Support
“How are you feeling now, having shared that? Do you need a break, maybe some water or just to breathe for a minute?”
“You did something incredibly brave just now. I know it’s painful, but you don’t have to go through this alone anymore. We will ensure your therapist knows (if you’re okay with that) so they can support you too. You have people on your side now.”
Closing Reassurance
“I’m so sorry you experienced that trauma. You survived – that shows how strong you are, even if you don’t feel that way. I believe you, and I believe in you. We’re going to help you get through this. One step at a time, at your pace.”

🟠 Relational Rupture / Intense Interpersonal Conflict
(Client is very upset about a conflict with a friend, partner, or family member – feeling betrayed, hurt, or enraged but not to the point of harming the person.)
Validate the Hurt/Anger
“It sounds like you’re really hurt and angry about what happened. That’s completely understandable – when someone we care about [does X], it can feel awful and infuriating.”
“Anyone would be upset in your situation. It shows how much this relationship matters to you; you wouldn’t feel this strongly if you didn’t care.”
Encourage Venting (Safely)
“Go ahead and tell me, what about it is hurting you the most? I’m here to listen and I won’t judge you.”
If they are very angry: “It’s okay to vent. Use whatever words you need to – I know you’re not literally going to [e.g., ‘kill them’], that’s just how extreme the anger feels. I get it.”
Prevent Overwhelm or Shutdown
“Let’s try to slow it just a bit so I can understand everything. I want to make sure I’m catching what’s most important to you in all of this.”
“Take a deep breath for a moment... I know it’s a lot. I’m not going anywhere; we have time to unpack it slowly.”
Reflect Back Key Feelings
“It sounds like you feel betrayed and disrespected. Like they didn’t value you or your feelings in that moment. Is that right?”
“No wonder you’re angry – your trust was broken. That really hurts.”
Brainstorm or Contain (depending on readiness)
“Given how raw this is, it might be best not to confront them while you’re feeling this angry. We can work out what you want to say when you’re calmer. For now, maybe focus on what you need to feel a bit better.”
“What do you think you need right now? Sometimes after a big fight or betrayal, doing something to take care of yourself can help (even something small like a walk, or listening to music that matches your mood).”
“If and when you want to address it with them, I can help you figure out how to express what you feel. It could be in a letter, or a calm conversation, or maybe with a therapist present – whatever feels right to you.”
Empower Boundaries
“Remember, you’re allowed to take space from this person if you need it. You don’t have to decide anything permanent while you’re this upset. It’s okay to give yourself time to cool off and think.”
“Your feelings matter, and it’s important they eventually hear how you feel, but in a way that they can really listen. We can plan for that when you’re ready.”
Assurance
“I know conflict with someone you care about is really painful. We’ll let your therapist know what’s going on, so they can help you navigate it too. You’re not alone in this. For now, I’m proud of you for talking it through instead of doing something impulsive in the heat of the moment. That shows a lot of restraint and thoughtfulness on your part.”
Cognitive reframe: Betrayal

🟠 Triggered by Group Content
(Client became triggered or upset by something that came up in group therapy content – perhaps another member’s story or a topic touched a nerve.)
Immediate Grounding & Nervous System Regulation
"Right now, it sounds like your nervous system got hijacked by whatever came up in group. That's what happens when we get triggered - our body reacts like the past is happening right now. Let's help your body remember that you're here, in the present, and you're safe."
"Can you bring your attention to your feet on the floor? Feel the solid ground beneath you. This is [current date], you're [location], and you're safe in this moment."
"Now let's try some breathing together to help calm your nervous system. We're going to breathe in a way that tells your body it's okay to settle. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts... hold for 4... and out through your mouth for 6 counts. That longer exhale is key."
[Breathe with them for several cycles]
"Place one hand on your heart and one on your belly. Feel the warmth of your own touch. This is your adult self taking care of your inner world right now."

Normalizing & Validating the Trigger Response
"What you're experiencing right now - this intense reaction to what came up in group - this is your nervous system doing exactly what it was designed to do. It's trying to protect you from something that felt familiar or dangerous."
"Triggers aren't weaknesses or failures - they're information. They tell us where we still have tender places that need care and attention. The fact that you got triggered means you're doing real, deep work."
"Can you tell me what specifically happened in group that activated this response? Sometimes naming it can help us understand what your system is reacting to."
[Listen without judgment, validate their experience]

Creating Distance from the Activation
"Right now, part of you might feel like you're back in [past situation/feeling] rather than here in the present responding to group content. Let's help you orient to where you actually are."
"That was then, this is now. In group today, you were safe. You were surrounded by people doing their own healing work. What happened [in the past] is not happening now."
"The feelings are real and valid, but let's separate the past from the present. Can you say with me: 'I am having feelings about the past. I am safe in the present moment.'"

Acknowledging Protector Parts
"It sounds like there's a part of you that got really activated when [specific group content] came up. This part is probably trying to protect you from something - maybe from being hurt, or from feeling vulnerable, or from remembering something painful."
"Let's get curious about this protector part with compassion. What is this part trying to protect you from? What is it afraid would happen if it didn't react so strongly to protect you?"
[Allow exploration of the protective function]
"Can we thank this part for working so hard to keep you safe? It sounds like it's been carrying a big job for a long time. Maybe we can let it know that you're an adult now with more resources than you had before."

Exploring the Trigger Without Re-traumatization
"When [specific content] came up in group, what did that touch on for you? We don't need to go deep into the story right now - just help me understand what nerve got hit."
"Sometimes group content can bring up our own experiences, or it can activate fears about being judged, or it can make us feel exposed or vulnerable. What felt most activated for you?"
"It's okay if you don't have words for it yet. Sometimes triggers happen in the body before the mind can make sense of them."

Cognitive Defusion from Triggered Thoughts
"I'm hearing some intense thoughts that got stirred up: '[their specific triggered thoughts].' Right now these thoughts feel absolutely true and urgent. Let's try something - can you add this phrase: 'I'm having the triggered thought that...' or 'My trauma is telling me that...'"
"So instead of 'Everyone in group thinks I'm broken,' it becomes 'I'm having the triggered thought that everyone thinks I'm broken.' Do you notice any difference when we say it that way?"
"When we're triggered, our mind goes to the worst-case scenarios and treats them like facts. But these are trauma thoughts, not necessarily reality thoughts."

Reality Testing vs. Trigger Stories
"When we get triggered, our mind creates stories to make sense of the activation. Right now, what story is your mind telling you about what happened in group, or about what people think of you, or about what this means?"
[Listen to their trigger narrative]
"Let's look at this story together. What evidence do we have that this story is actually true? And what evidence might contradict it? I'm not trying to dismiss your feelings - I want us to separate what actually happened from what your triggered mind is adding to it."
"Has your trauma told you similar stories before? How often have these worst-case scenarios actually played out the way trauma predicted?"

Self-Compassion for Being Triggered
"First, I want to acknowledge how hard it is to get triggered, especially in a group setting. There might be shame or embarrassment about having such a strong reaction. Let's address that."
"Getting triggered doesn't mean you're not healing or that you're doing something wrong. It means you're human, and you're doing brave work by being in group in the first place. Let's try a self-compassion break."
"Can you acknowledge: 'This is a moment of suffering. Getting triggered is really difficult.' Then connect to our shared humanity: 'Everyone in healing work gets triggered sometimes. This is part of the process.'"
"Now, with your hand on your heart, can you offer yourself kindness: 'May I be gentle with myself. May I treat myself with the same compassion I'd show a friend who got triggered in group.'"

Reframing the Group Experience
"Right now, your triggered mind might be telling you that group isn't safe, or that you shouldn't have shared, or that everyone is judging you. Let's look at this differently."
"What if getting triggered in group is actually a sign that you're in the right place? Group is designed to bring up our stuff so we can heal it. The fact that something got activated means the work is happening."
"Think about the other group members - when someone else gets triggered or shares something vulnerable, how do you respond to them? Do you judge them, or do you feel compassion and connection?"
"It's likely that others in group understand exactly what you're going through. Your trigger might have even helped someone else feel less alone in their own struggles."

Planning Return to Group
"I know it might feel scary to think about going back to group after getting triggered like this. That's completely understandable. Let's talk about how you might handle it."
"You have some choices: you could share with the group that you got triggered and what you learned from it, you could talk to the group leader privately, or you could just show up and see how you feel. What feels most manageable for you?"
"Remember, getting triggered in group and then working through it is actually modeling courage and resilience for other group members. Your vulnerability gives others permission to be real too."
"What would you need to feel safer in group going forward? Maybe a signal with the facilitator, or permission to step out if you need to ground yourself?"

Opposite Action for Shame/Avoidance
"Right now, shame and fear might be telling you to avoid group, to isolate, to not talk about what happened. While that urge makes sense, avoiding might actually make the trigger stronger and the shame heavier."
"What would be the opposite of what shame is telling you to do? Instead of hiding, what if you reached out to one safe person from group? Instead of avoiding, what if you showed up next time and trusted that you can handle whatever comes up?"
"We're not talking about forcing yourself to be vulnerable beyond your capacity. We're talking about one small step opposite to the direction shame wants to pull you."

Building Trigger Recovery Skills
"Now that we've worked through this trigger together, let's think about building your trigger recovery toolkit. What helped most today? The breathing, the grounding, talking it through?"
"Next time you get triggered - and there probably will be a next time because that's part of healing - what's the first thing you want to remember to do? Maybe the breathing, or reminding yourself 'that was then, this is now'?"
"Who else in your support system could you reach out to when you get triggered? Sometimes we need more than one person to help us come back to center."

Integration & Meaning-Making
"Getting triggered is never pleasant, but it can also be informative. What is this trigger teaching you about what you still need to heal or what you need to feel safer?"
"Sometimes triggers show us where we've grown too - maybe you handled this one differently than you would have in the past, or maybe you reached out for support instead of suffering alone."
"How do you want to carry this experience forward? What do you want to remember from working through this trigger together?"

Closing & Continued Support
"I'm really proud of you for reaching out when you got triggered instead of just suffering through it alone. That shows incredible self-awareness and courage."
"Triggers are hard, but they're also opportunities to practice new ways of caring for yourself. You just did that by calling me today."
"What's one thing you can do to take care of yourself for the rest of today? Maybe something soothing, or grounding, or connecting with support?"
"Remember, getting triggered doesn't mean you're broken or not ready for group work. It means you're doing the brave work of healing, and healing isn't always comfortable."
"You can always call the crisis line at [number] if you need support, and I encourage you to reach out to your group facilitator too. They've seen this before and they want to support you."
"Before we hang up, let's do one more grounding moment together. Feel your feet on the floor, take three deep breaths with me, and remember - you're safe, you're here in the present, and you're not alone."

Normalize Triggers
“It makes a lot of sense that you felt triggered by what came up in group. Sometimes other people’s stories can stir up feelings or memories we didn’t expect. That doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you – it means you’re human and you have experiences that were touched by that topic.”
“Group can bring up big feelings out of the blue. It happens to a lot of people, even if they don’t show it.”
Check Understanding
“Can you tell me what part of the group conversation hit you hard? Was it something specific that someone said or the topic in general?”
If they can’t articulate: “That’s okay if it’s not clear. Sometimes triggers are more of a body memory or a vague feeling. We can work with what you’re feeling now without pinpointing the exact reason, if that’s easier.”
Re-ground and Stabilize
“Let’s come back to the here and now first. You’re with me, you’re safe. The group conversation is over (or on pause) and we’re just sitting here talking.”
“Take a deep breath, maybe stretch your arms or wiggle your fingers, just to get back into your body.”
Validate Feelings
“It sounds like what you heard in group made you feel [sad/angry/scared/alone]. That feeling is completely valid. Group topics can really open old wounds or sensitive spots.”
“You’re not overreacting – your mind and body are responding to something real for you. We might not have known this topic would do that, but now we know, and we can handle it.”
Coping Right Now
“What would help you right now to feel a little more steady? Maybe stepping outside for a few minutes? Or just staying here in this quieter space with me for a bit longer until you feel okay to return?”
“It’s perfectly fine if you don’t go back to group today. We can let the facilitator know you needed some time. Your well-being comes first.”
Plan for Future Triggers
“If you’re open to it, we can talk to your therapist about this trigger so they know this topic is sensitive for you. They might be able to give you a heads-up if it’s going to come up again, or work with you on it individually.”
“Also, if you ever feel triggered in group again, you now know you can step out and talk to me or another coach. That option is always available – that’s exactly why I’m here.”
Affirmation
“I’m glad you took a break and talked to me about it. That’s a healthy response to feeling overwhelmed. You honored your limits, and that’s good. We’ll make sure you’re supported around this trigger moving forward. You’re definitely not alone – we’ll get through it together.”

🟠 Conflict in Group or with Staff
(Client got into a heated argument in group or feels wronged by a staff member – very upset but not at risk of violence, just emotionally charged and possibly embarrassed or resentful.)
Acknowledge Emotions
“That conflict back there really upset you, and I can see why. It’s hard when you feel misunderstood (or disrespected) in front of others.”
“I noticed you left the situation, which is actually a smart way to prevent it from getting worse. I’m glad you took a timeout.”
Give Space to Vent (Privately)
“Go ahead and tell me what bothered you most about what happened. I’m listening.”
“It sounds like you felt [insulted/ignored/misunderstood] by what was said. That would upset me too.”
“You’re angry because you care about being heard and treated fairly. Those are completely valid feelings.”
Repair & Perspective
“Sometimes in group settings, things come out wrong or people step on each other’s toes without meaning to. I’m not sure if that’s what happened, but it might be. We can figure out if this was a misunderstanding or if something genuinely inappropriate happened.”
“From what I saw, I wonder if [other person/staff] might not have realized how their words came across to you. It doesn’t make it okay, but maybe they weren’t intentionally trying to hurt you. What do you think?”
Plan a Constructive Follow-Up
“If you feel up to it, we can talk about how to address this. Would you want to speak with [the person] one-on-one with a mediator, maybe me or your therapist, present? Or would you prefer writing down what you feel and sharing it? It’s also okay if you need some time before addressing it.”
“Your voice matters, and I want to help make sure it’s heard in a respectful way. We can help the other person understand how it affected you, whenever you’re ready.”
Boundary Setting (if needed)
“If you don’t feel comfortable with that person right now, that’s understandable. We can arrange group so you don’t have to interact much until this is resolved. Your sense of safety in the program is important.”
“If it was a staff member who upset you, I can assist you in bringing it up to the right channels. You deserve to be treated with respect by everyone, including staff. We can make sure your concerns are heard by the clinical team.”
Encourage Return (when ready)
“Whenever you feel okay to go back to group (if today), I can walk in with you and stay by your side. Or if you prefer, you can take the rest of today off from group and we’ll just let them know you needed some time. Whatever makes you feel more comfortable.”
“Conflict happens, but it doesn’t mean you don’t belong or that everything is ruined. I guarantee others will move forward and we can repair this. I’ll help make sure of that.”
Affirm Self-Advocacy
“I’m really glad you told me how you feel. You have every right to speak up when something isn’t okay for you. We’ll work on resolving this so you feel safe and respected. You’re not overreacting; your feelings are valid. Let’s make a plan together to fix this misunderstanding or mistreatment.”

🟠 Anger and Irritability (beyond mild agitation)
(Client is constantly on edge, snapping in irritation, or seething with anger that isn’t explosive but is persistent and consuming them.)
Acknowledge the Emotion
“You’ve been feeling a lot of anger lately – like a constant simmering. That’s exhausting, isn’t it? And maybe a little confusing or even guilt-inducing for you?”
“It’s okay to feel angry. Anger is a normal emotion. It often comes when we feel hurt, or trapped, or disrespected. It’s there to signal something’s not right.”
Invite Insight
“Do you have a sense of what’s underneath the anger? Often there’s pain or fear hiding under anger’s umbrella. For example, sometimes we’re really sad or afraid, but it’s easier to feel mad. Does that resonate at all, or is it just pure frustration for you?”
If client identifies a source: “That makes sense. You feel angry about X because it really matters to you. Anyone would be upset in that situation.”
If no clear source: “Even if you can’t pinpoint exactly why, your body is telling you it’s upset about something. We can still help you cope with the feeling.”
Nonjudgmental Stance
“I’m not afraid or upset with you for feeling this way. I just want to help you find a way to experience it without it burning you up or causing trouble for you.”
“Sometimes we think being angry means we’re a ‘bad person’ or out of control, but honestly anger can be harnessed. It’s all about what you do with it.”
Coping Strategies for Anger
“Would it help to channel some of this physically? We could try something like punching a pillow, doing some quick jumping jacks, or scribbling all your angry thoughts on paper and then tearing it up. That can release some of the pressure safely.”
“Another thing we can try is taking a step back and asking: what does this anger want me to do? If it’s telling me something like ‘this situation is unfair’, maybe it wants you to speak up or set a boundary. We can figure that out together.”
“Even just naming it – ‘I am angry because ___’ – can take a little of its power away. You did some of that just now by talking to me.”
Slow Down and Soothe
“Let’s practice one thing: when you feel that surge of irritation, before it boils over, try to take one deep breath or even step away for a minute. It sounds simple, but that tiny pause can keep anger from controlling what you do next.”
“We can also try a quick calming exercise if you’re up for it: breathe in deeply, count to four, then exhale slowly for six or eight counts. Longer exhales can actually signal your body to relax a bit, which can soften anger’s edge. Let’s try it once now together.”
Validate Progress
“Look at that – you’re talking about your anger calmly with me right now. That shows you can be in charge of it, rather than it in charge of you. That’s huge.”
“Anger isn’t inherently bad. It’s all about channeling it in a way that doesn’t hurt you or others. We’ll let your therapist know anger has been at the forefront for you; maybe you two can come up with even more strategies, like using that energy for something productive (art, exercise, advocacy).”
Affirmation
“I really appreciate your honesty about feeling this way. Many people would shy away from admitting they’re angry, but you faced it. That’s strong. Remember, you’re not an ‘angry person’ – you’re a person feeling anger. It’s one part of you, and it doesn’t define you. We’ll work on this, and I’m here for you throughout.”

🟨 Yellow Zone – Moderate Challenges
(Moderate distress where the client is upset or struggling but still able to engage with some guidance. Focus on de-escalation, problem-solving, and skill use. These situations require support and structured intervention, but not emergency action.)

🟨 Resistant / Ambivalent About Therapy
(Client is disengaged, skeptical, or saying “I don’t want help” even though they’re struggling.)
Acknowledge Autonomy
“It’s okay if you’re not sure about this or even if you don’t want help right now. You’re in control here – I’m not going to force anything on you.”
“You have every right to feel hesitant. Maybe support hasn’t felt helpful in the past, or it’s hard to trust it. That makes sense.”
Gently Explore Resistance
“Can I ask, what’s your biggest concern about accepting help? If you’d rather not say, that’s fine, but if we talk about it, maybe we can address it together.”
“Sometimes people worry they’ll be judged, or that talking won’t change anything. If that’s how you feel, I get it. A lot of people feel that way until they find a approach that works for them.”
Affirm Their Pace
“We can go as slow as you want. Maybe we don’t dive into anything deep today. We could just chat about surface stuff or even sit in silence if that feels safer. I’m here whenever you do feel like talking – if not now, maybe another time.”
“You don’t owe me anything. My job is to support you in whatever way you’re comfortable with. Even if that means just sitting together or talking about the weather until you feel ready.”
Offer Control
“How about this – you tell me what you would find helpful right now, if anything. Even if it’s something small like ‘give me five minutes of quiet’ or ‘just listen while I rant about something unrelated.’ We can start there.”
“If you really don’t want to be here, we can also discuss what the alternatives are. I’m not here to trap you. I genuinely want to help, but I respect that it’s your choice how or if you use this time.”
Subtle Encouragement
“You’ve been fighting your battles alone for a while, I gather. You’ve survived up to now on your own strength. That’s impressive. Needing or accepting help doesn’t make you weak – if anything, it can lighten the load so you can keep going strong in other areas.”
"Therapy often feels like taking one step forward and two steps back. That's not failure—that's how change works."
End on Respect
“I respect you for being honest that you’re not into this right now. That’s actually really helpful for me to know. How about we check in about it later? If you decide you want something from me, even if it’s weeks from now, just say the word. I’ve got your back on your terms.”

🟨 Group Resistant
Let's reframe this: What if group isn't about 'fixing' everything, but about practicing new ways of relating to yourself and others, even when it's imperfect?”

"This program asks a lot. And the reason it asks a lot is because the things you're working towards are significant. How can the group support you in meeting those demands today?”

🟨 “Manipulative” or Testing Behaviors
(Client appears to be seeking attention or playing people against each other, e.g., exaggerating stories, threatening mild consequences for reaction, or otherwise engaging in behaviors often labeled as “manipulative.” The goal is to address the underlying need without shaming.)
Look Under the Behavior
“It seems like you really need something right now – maybe reassurance, or to feel in control? I want to understand what you need, because I don’t think you’re doing these things for no reason.”
“Sometimes when people act in certain ways – like exaggerating or saying things to provoke a reaction – it’s because they’re really hurting or needing attention and not sure how to ask for it directly. If that’s you, it’s okay. We all need attention and care sometimes.”
Call Out Needs, Not Character
“I don’t see you as ‘manipulative.’ I see someone who’s trying hard to get their needs met. Maybe you’ve learned to survive by reading people and trying to get a response. That tells me you might have felt ignored or unheard in the past.”
“How about we skip the part where you have to escalate things to get me to care – because I already care. You have my full attention right now, no matter what.”
Encourage Direct Communication
“You shouldn’t have to test me to see if I’ll support you. I want you to know: if you need something, you can ask me as plainly as possible. I will do my best to help, as long as it’s safe and within my role.”
“For example, instead of feeling like you have to say something extreme for me to take you seriously, you could tell me, ‘I’m feeling really alone and I need someone to hear me.’ And I promise I will.”
Set Gentle Boundaries
“I also need to be honest with you: when I get the sense that facts are getting exaggerated (or I’m being pitted against another staff member), it confuses me about what you truly need. I’d rather spend our time actually helping you, you know? Let’s try to keep our communication straight so I don’t miss what’s really going on.”
“If I ever say or do something that makes you feel you’re not getting what you need, you can tell me directly – even if it’s ‘you’re not listening to me!’ I won’t be upset. I’d appreciate knowing, so I can correct it.”
Reinforce Positive Attempts
“I noticed you just told me very clearly that you feel nobody understands you. That was really direct and I appreciate it. See – you can tell me exactly what you feel, and I’m listening. You don’t have to hint or resort to extremes. This is good, honest communication we’re doing right now.”
“I’m here and I’m not going to ignore you or abandon you. You have my attention and I want to help. You can relax on the tactics; you’ve got me on your side already.”
Address Underlying Feelings
“My guess is there’s some fear of not being taken seriously, or maybe fear of abandonment, that might be driving this. If that’s true, I want you to know I see you and I’m not abandoning you. Even if I step away or end a session, I’ll come back or someone else will be there. You’re not going to be left alone in your pain.”
“Let’s work together to get your needs met more directly. I value your trust, and I want you to get what you need without feeling like you have to pull strings or push buttons to get it.”
End with Empathy
“I hope you can feel that I genuinely care about you and not just about your behavior. I see a person who’s been let down a lot and is trying to make sure it doesn’t happen again. That makes total sense. I’m here to prove to you that you can get support without having to fight so hard for it. You deserve that.”

🟨 Shut Down, Withdrawn, or Minimizing
(Client is quiet, giving one-word answers, or saying “It’s fine, I’m fine” when clearly they are not. Possibly dissociating or just reluctant to open up.)
Gently Call It Out
“I notice you’re getting really quiet (or you keep saying you’re fine). Sometimes when people get really quiet, it’s because the feelings are too much or too hard to put into words. Does that feel true for you right now?”
“It’s okay if you don’t feel like talking. You don’t have to force yourself to say anything you’re not ready to.”
Permission to Be Silent
“We can sit here together without talking for a bit if that’s what you need. I’m not uncomfortable with the silence if you aren’t. Sometimes just having someone nearby is enough.”
“If you want me to just quietly be here or maybe talk about something low-pressure (like a TV show or the weather) until you feel ready, I can do that too. You tell me what you need right now.”
Validate Uncertainty
“Sometimes we don’t even know what’s wrong or what we’re feeling, and that can make it hard to talk. If you’re not sure what’s going on inside, that’s okay. We can just focus on grounding you until things become a bit clearer.”
“Or maybe you do know what’s wrong but it’s hard to say it. That’s okay too. You don’t owe me any explanation. I trust that if and when you want to share, you will.”
Alternate Expression
“If talking is hard, would you prefer to write down what you’re feeling? Or even draw it? Some people find that easier than saying it out loud. I’m open to whatever method works for you.”
“You could even just give me a word or two that describes what’s happening inside, if that feels easier. Like ‘numb’ or ‘angry’ or ‘tired’ – and we can start from there, or not, up to you.”
Assure Continued Support
“I want you to know I’m here for you, even if you’re not ready to engage actively. I’m not going anywhere. We can just share the space.”
“Your pace is absolutely fine. There’s no rush to delve into anything you don’t want to. If you decide later that you do want to talk, you can always come back or reach out to me.”
After Some Time – Gentle Nudge
If time is passing quietly, softly say: “I’m still here with you. Just checking in – how’s your breathing? Maybe take a nice deep breath with me, just to help a tiny bit.” (Breathe together quietly.)
“Would you like a sip of water or to walk around the room for a second? Sometimes a little physical movement or hydration can help when we’re in our shell.”
Accept Minimal Engagement
“Even if all you do today is show up and sit here, that’s okay. That’s a big step on its own. Some days just being present is an accomplishment.”
“We can end early if that’s better for you, or just keep sitting until the time’s up. You tell me. No judgment either way.”
Closing if they stay quiet
“I want to say that I’m proud of you for coming here even though it’s hard to talk. That shows courage. Whenever you’re ready to share, I’m ready to listen. And if today wasn’t the day, there will be another opportunity. You’re not alone, even in silence.”

🟨 Loneliness and Isolation
(Client feels profoundly alone, isolated, or believes they have no one.)
Validate the Pain of Loneliness
“Feeling lonely can be incredibly painful. I hear you – it’s like you’re aching for connection and it’s nowhere to be found. That’s a really heavy thing to carry.”
“You can be surrounded by people and still feel alone – that kind of loneliness is tough. It makes sense you’re hurting.”
Assure Them They’re Not Alone Right Now
“Well, you’re not alone at this exact moment. I’m here with you, and I care about what you’re feeling. I know I’m just one person and not a long-term fix, but I want you to know, right now in this space, you are seen and heard.”
“It might sound cheesy, but you and I, we’re a little team right now. I’m in your corner.”
Explore Opportunities for Connection (Gently)
“Let’s think of one small way to feel a bit more connected. Is there anyone – even an acquaintance or a family member – you could send a text to later today, just to say hi? You don’t have to spill your guts to them, just a simple connection.”
“Sometimes volunteering or joining a group around an interest (like a class or a club) can slowly build a sense of connection. I’m not suggesting you go hug strangers on the street, just maybe consider places where people with similar interests hang out. Is there anything you enjoy that you might do around others, like a gym, a hobby workshop, a gaming community online? No rush, just something to think about.”
Address Possible Self-Blame
“Loneliness often makes people feel like ‘there’s something wrong with me.’ If you’re thinking that – there isn’t. Many people feel lonely for all kinds of reasons: moving to a new place, friends drifting away, depression making it hard to reach out, etc. It’s not because you’re unworthy of friendship or love.”
“You said you feel like no one would even notice if you disappeared. I would notice. Your therapist would notice. I guarantee there are others who would too, even if it doesn’t feel like it. Sometimes people just aren’t great at showing it, but it doesn’t mean they don’t care.”
Encourage Small Connections
“What about something like going to a coffee shop or a park where others are around, even if you don’t talk to them? Just being near people can help a tiny bit to remind our brains we’re part of a community. Or maybe saying a small ‘hello’ to a neighbor or the cashier at a store – little interactions count more than we realize.”
“If deeper connections are what you want (which is totally understandable), maybe we start with one person you think you could reach out to. It could even be an old friend you haven’t spoken to in a while. You might be surprised – they could be really happy to hear from you.”
Plan & Hope
“I know it might be hard to believe right now, but feelings of loneliness can change. New people can come into our lives at the most unexpected times. Part of our work can be preparing you to notice and welcome those opportunities.”
“For now, how about we identify one thing you can do this week that might bring even a little connection? It could be as simple as commenting something nice on someone’s social media post, or asking a coworker about their day. Baby steps are fine.”
Affirmation
“It took courage to admit how lonely you feel. That’s a step toward change. You deserve to feel connected and valued – because you are. I believe that there are people out there who will value you as much as you value them. It might take time, but you won’t always feel as alone as you do today. Until then, you’ve got me, your therapist, and others here who truly care about you.”

🟨 Shame, Self-Hatred, or Guilt
(Client expresses strong negative feelings about themselves: “I hate myself,” “I’m a terrible person,” or overwhelming guilt over something.)
Immediately Counter Global Negativity
“I hear you saying some really harsh things about yourself. I know those feelings are very real for you right now. But I have to tell you, from where I sit, you are not a terrible person. You’re a person who is hurting.”
“I hear you saying, ‘I’m a terrible person.’ Let’s try and reframe that. Is it more accurate to say, ‘I did something I regret’? There’s a big difference between being a failure and doing something that didn’t work out. One is a temporary action; the other is a permanent label.”
“It sounds like you’re holding yourself to an impossible standard. Whatever you did (or think you did), it doesn’t make you worthless or evil. It makes you human.”
Get Specific (if possible)
“Can we talk about what’s making you feel so ashamed? What do you believe you did that’s so unforgivable?”
If client opens up about it: “Thank you for telling me. I know it’s hard to even say it out loud. From an outside perspective, I see someone who made a mistake (if it was a mistake) or had something happen to them, but I do not see a fundamentally bad person.”
If they say “everything” or can’t specify: “That feeling like every single thing about you is wrong – that’s a heavy blanket of shame. Usually, that comes from messages you’ve gotten over time, not from objective truth. No baby is born hating themselves; it’s taught by others or by painful experiences.”
Empathy and Common Humanity
“I want you to imagine if your best friend came to you and confessed the exact same thing you’re feeling guilty about. Would you tell them they’re a horrible person? Probably not. You’d likely see nuance and offer them compassion. You deserve that same compassion from yourself.”
“One mistake or even a handful of them don’t define your entire character. We are all a mix of good and not-so-good actions. What matters is you care – and I can see you do care, because you feel guilt and shame. Truly bad people don’t usually feel that.”
Challenge Cognitive Distortions (gently)
“It sounds like you believe that because X happened, you are 100% bad. Let’s test that a bit: Have you ever done something kind or good in your life? (They might say no.) I can list at least one – you showed up here today, and you’ve been honest about how you feel. That’s an act of courage and honesty, which are good qualities.”
“Let’s try a hypothetical: If someone makes a mistake at work, does that make them a mistake as a person? Likely you’d say no, of course not. So why is it different for you? Why is the bar for you so much harsher?”
Separate Actions from Self
“Maybe you did something you regret. That action might have been harmful, and we can acknowledge that and make amends if possible. But you are not equal to that action. You are a whole person, and that thing is one piece of the story, not the whole book.”
If it’s guilt: “Is there anything you can or want to do to make the situation better or to apologize? Sometimes taking responsible action can lessen guilt. And once you’ve done what you can, it’s important to work on forgiving yourself. You’ve been punishing yourself non-stop in your head, and that’s not actually helping anyone.”
If it’s shame (feeling you ARE bad): “Shame often comes from how others treated you. It could be that you were made to feel ‘not good enough’ growing up or in some relationship. That voice in your head telling you you’re bad might not even be your voice – it might be someone else’s that you internalized. Recognizing that can help you challenge it.”
Encourage Self-Compassion
“You know, you have survived 100% of your worst days so far, and you’re still trying. That tells me you’re resilient and you care. Maybe try talking to yourself as you would to a dear friend: you might say, ‘Hey, you’re doing the best you can. You screwed up, but you’re still worthy of love and you can do better tomorrow.’ Can you try to grant yourself a bit of that kindness?”
“What if we come up with one small affirmation or even a neutral statement you can tell yourself when the self-hatred creeps in? Even something like, ‘I’m human and I’m learning,’ or ‘I have worth beyond this moment.’ It might feel corny, but over time it can fight back against that harsh inner critic.”

Addressing the Inner Critic Directly
"I'm hearing a voice in your head that's being incredibly harsh and critical. This sounds like what we might call 'The Inner Critic' - and it's being really loud right now. What exactly is this Critic telling you about yourself?"
[Let them share the specific critical messages]
"That Critic has some very strong opinions about you. But here's what I want you to consider - you are not that voice. You are the person who can hear that voice. There's a difference between you and The Critic that lives in your head."
"Let's get curious about this Critic for a moment. From a place of compassion, can we ask this part: 'What are you trying to protect me from? What are you afraid would happen if you stopped being so harsh with me?' Often these critical voices developed to try to keep us safe somehow."

Self-Compassion Break for Shame
"What you're experiencing right now is shame - that deep feeling that there's something fundamentally wrong with you. Shame thrives in isolation and secrecy, but it begins to lose power when we meet it with compassion."
"Let's try a Self-Compassion Break together. First, can you acknowledge what's happening: 'This is a moment of suffering. This shame is really painful.' You don't have to like it - just acknowledge it's here."
[Pause]
"Second, let's connect to our shared humanity: 'Shame is part of the human experience. I'm not the only person who has ever felt this way.' Millions of people have carried shame exactly like yours."
"Now, with your hand still on your heart, can you offer yourself some kindness: 'May I be gentle with myself. May I treat myself with the same compassion I'd show a good friend.' What would you say to a dear friend who was feeling exactly what you're feeling right now?"

Separating Identity from Behavior/Experience
"I keep hearing you say things like 'I'm disgusting,' 'I'm worthless,' 'I'm a terrible person.' These are identity statements - they're about who you think you are as a person. Let's pause and look at this differently."
"Is it more accurate to say 'I did something I regret' rather than 'I am a bad person'? Or 'Something painful happened to me' rather than 'I am damaged goods'? There's a huge difference between having an experience and being defined by that experience."
"You are not your worst moment. You are not your biggest mistake. You are not what happened to you. You are a whole, complex human being who has had difficult experiences."

Cognitive Defusion for Shame Thoughts
"These thoughts about yourself - 'I'm worthless,' 'I'm disgusting' - they feel absolutely true right now. Let's try something. Can you add this phrase: 'I'm having the thought that...' So 'I'm worthless' becomes 'I'm having the thought that I'm worthless.'"
"Try it with me. Instead of 'I'm a terrible person,' say 'I'm having the thought that I'm a terrible person.' Do you notice any shift? Sometimes this little phrase can create space between you and these painful thoughts."
"These thoughts aren't facts about you - they're just mental events, like clouds passing through the sky of your mind."

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Self-Hatred
"This self-hatred, this harsh inner voice - it's been with you for a while. Let's look at this objectively. What are the advantages of being so hard on yourself? How does the self-criticism serve you? Some people say it motivates them or keeps them from making mistakes."
[Let them explore any perceived benefits]
"Now let's look at the costs. What does this self-hatred cost you emotionally? How does it affect your relationships, your choices, your daily life? What does it cost you to carry this much pain about yourself?"
"Looking at both sides, is this self-hatred actually helping you become the person you want to be, or is it keeping you stuck?"

Radical Acceptance of Imperfection
"Part of what's happening here is that you're fighting against the reality of being human - which means being imperfect, making mistakes, sometimes doing things we regret. Every single human being has parts of themselves or their past they wish were different."
"Radical acceptance doesn't mean approving of everything you've done or everything that's happened. It means acknowledging reality: 'I am human. I am imperfect. I have made mistakes. This is part of the human experience.'"
"What would it feel like to stop fighting against your own humanity? To stop demanding perfection from yourself in a way you'd never demand from anyone else?"

Acknowledging Protector Parts
"It sounds like there are parts of you working really hard to keep you safe. Maybe there's a part that thinks if it criticizes you enough, you won't make mistakes again. Or a part that thinks if it hates you first, others can't hurt you as badly."
"Can we appreciate these parts for trying to protect you, even though their methods are causing you pain? From a place of curiosity, what is this self-attacking part afraid would happen if it stopped being so harsh?"
"These parts developed for good reasons, but they might be working overtime. Can we let them know that you hear their concerns, but maybe there are gentler ways to stay safe?"

Opposite Action for Shame
"Shame is telling you to hide, to isolate, to make yourself small, to avoid connection. That's what shame does - it wants you to withdraw. But isolation actually feeds shame and makes it stronger."
"What would be the opposite of what shame is telling you to do? Instead of hiding, what if you reached out to one safe person? Instead of avoiding, what if you did one small thing that brings you closer to your values?"
"We don't have to do anything big - just one small step in the direction opposite to what shame is demanding. What would feel manageable for you?"

Rewriting the Narrative
"The story you're telling yourself about who you are has become very painful and very limiting. But here's the thing about stories - they can be rewritten. You get to be the author of your own narrative."
"If a wise, compassionate person who truly knew you were to tell your story, how might they tell it differently? What would they say about your struggles, your growth, your humanity?"
"You are not a villain in your own story. You're a human being doing your best with the tools and understanding you have. That's not an excuse - it's the truth."

Building Micro-Moments of Self-Compassion
"Changing how you relate to yourself doesn't happen overnight. But we can start with micro-moments. What's one tiny way you could be gentler with yourself today? Maybe speaking to yourself the way you'd speak to a small child who was hurt?"
"When that critical voice gets loud, can you try responding with: 'I see you're in pain right now, and that's okay. You're doing the best you can.' Just like you would comfort a friend."

Closing & Continued Support
"The fact that you're here, talking about this pain instead of just suffering with it alone, tells me something important about your strength and your desire to heal. That matters."
"Shame wants you to believe you're alone and that you're too broken to be loved or accepted. But you've just proven shame wrong by reaching out and letting me sit with you in this pain."
"What's one small act of self-care you can do in the next few hours? Not because you deserve to be punished less, but because you deserve basic human kindness - including from yourself."
"Remember, you don't have to love yourself right now. You don't even have to like yourself. You just have to be willing to stop actively hating yourself. Can you try being neutral toward yourself, the way you might feel toward a stranger?
End with Hope
“I see good in you. I really do. You might not be ready to see it yet, and that’s okay. Until you do, I’ll hold that positive view of you and remind you of it. You are not the worst thing you’ve ever done. You’re not the worst thoughts you’ve ever had. You’re a complex, valuable person who’s struggling right now. And I’m here to help you through that struggle, not to judge you for it.”

🟨 Body Image Issues
(Client is fixated on body dissatisfaction – “I hate my body,” “I feel so ugly/fat,” etc., possibly not at an eating disorder crisis level but persistent negative body talk.)
Validate Feelings (Don’t Dismiss)
“It’s really hard to feel uncomfortable in your own body. That’s a very real kind of pain. I hear that you’re unhappy with how you look (or a part of your body). In a world that bombards us with certain images, it’s no wonder you feel this way.”
“You’re certainly not alone in those feelings. So many people, even those who seem confident, struggle with body image. It doesn’t make it less painful, but just so you know – it’s a common human experience.”
Gently Challenge Harsh Statements
“When you say, ‘I hate my body’ – that’s a strong, blanket statement. I wonder, are there any parts of your body or things it does that you don’t hate? Even something small, like ‘I like my eyes’ or ‘my body gets me from place to place each day’?”
“Your body is more than its shape or size. It’s carried you through every experience of your life. It deserves some credit for that, even if you wish parts of it were different.”
Promote Body Neutrality over Negativity
“You don’t have to love your body right now – that can feel impossible if you’re really unhappy with it. Maybe we aim for neutrality first. For example, instead of ‘I hate my legs,’ maybe ‘My legs allow me to walk, even if I don’t like how they look.’ It’s acknowledging their function without focusing on appearance.”
“It might help to remember that your body is the least interesting thing about you when it comes to the people who care about you. Your friends, family, and certainly I – we care about your humor, your kindness, your ideas, your quirks. Those aren’t changed by a number on a scale or a clothing size.”
Address Distorted Thoughts
“When you look in the mirror, what’s the self-talk that kicks in? Like, do you immediately start insulting yourself? If so, that voice is being a bully. We need to stand up to that bully a bit. What would you say to a friend who said the exact same things about their body that you say about yours?”
If client would reassure a friend: “Right – you’d probably tell them they’re more than their body, or that they look fine. You deserve that same compassion. It’s hard, I know. But try to catch that bully voice and maybe counter with something a supportive friend (or I) might say instead.”
Small Steps to Comfort
“Are there any clothes that you feel a bit more comfortable in? Sometimes wearing something soft or loose can help when you’re having a really bad body image day. It doesn’t solve the feelings, but it can ease the discomfort.”
“It might also help to do something that connects you with your body in a positive way that’s not about looks. Like stretching, or taking a warm shower and focusing on how it relaxes your muscles, or even gently massaging your hands or temples. Treat your body as an instrument rather than an ornament, if that makes sense.”
Plan for Triggers
“If social media or certain people make you feel worse about your body, it’s okay to take a break from those. Curate your feed or environment to have more body-positive or body-diverse influences. It can honestly retrain your brain over time to see beauty in different forms.”
“We can also loop in your therapist to maybe work more on this, or even involve a nutritionist or doctor if health behaviors are a concern. But right now, I want you to know I care about you, not what you look like. And I’m 100% sure anyone worth having in your life feels the same.”
Affirmation
“Your body is part of you, but it doesn’t define you. I know it’s hard to believe when you’re feeling this way, but you have inherent worth that has nothing to do with your appearance. You are worthy of kindness and respect – from others and from yourself. I’m going to keep reminding you of that, and we’ll take this one day at a time together.”

🟨 Hopelessness or Despair (without active suicidal intent)
(Client feels like “nothing will ever get better” but is not currently suicidal, just deeply discouraged and defeated.)
Meet Them in the Darkness
“It sounds like you are in a really dark place right now, like you can’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. That level of hopelessness is a heavy burden.”
“I know you said you’re not suicidal, but you kind of wish life would just stop. That’s an awful feeling to wake up with. It makes sense that you feel exhausted and done with everything.”
Acknowledge the Strength in Survival
“Even though you feel like there’s no point, you’re here talking to me. That tells me that somewhere, even if it’s a tiny flicker, there’s a part of you that hasn’t given up. You don’t have to feel hopeful right now – I can hold hope for you until you’re able to feel it again yourself.”
“Sometimes we have to borrow hope from others. Is it okay if I believe that things can change, even if you don’t believe it today? I’ve seen people come out of pits like this, and I truly believe you can too. I’ll keep that hope safe for you in the meantime.”
Focus on Immediate Next Step
“When the future looks blank or bleak, don’t even worry about the future right now. Let’s just focus on getting through today, or even just the next hour. What’s one small thing you can do after we talk that’s just… basic? Like, have you eaten anything today? Maybe start with a glass of water or a cup of tea. Basic self-care is victory when you’re feeling like this.”
“The sun will set tonight, time will pass, and tomorrow will come. We just need to help you get from one moment to the next. You don’t have to see a shining purpose right now. Just breathe and get through the next five minutes. Then the next.”
Validate Feelings, Gently Challenge Absolutes
“It sounds like you believe nothing will ever change. I won’t argue with how you feel because I respect that that’s real for you. But I will say that feelings can trick us. Because you feel 0% hope now, you might assume it’ll be 0% forever. But feelings are like the weather – sometimes there are long storms… and sometimes, eventually, the clouds do part. You might not see it coming, but it can happen.”
“Can you remember a time in your life, even a small moment, when you didn’t feel this bad? Or something happened that you didn’t expect, maybe a positive surprise? If it happened before, it can happen again.”
Engage Values or Meaning if Possible
“When you feel a tiny bit better – not now, but maybe some time – it could help to reconnect with something that used to matter to you. Is there any activity or person that used to give you even a spark of interest or peace? We could aim to slowly invite that back in. But if nothing comes to mind or nothing feels meaningful now, that’s okay. We can shelf that until you’re ready.”
“Sometimes when people feel hopeless, doing something kind for someone else can spark a glimmer of purpose. Like volunteering or helping a friend. It sounds counterintuitive when you’re empty, but giving can sometimes ignite a little light. No pressure – just something to consider down the line.”
Assure Continuous Support
“You might feel like no one can help and nothing will help – but I’m still going to be here and try. I don’t find you hopeless. I see someone who’s in a lot of pain and can’t see a way out yet. That word ‘yet’ is important. I have seen people find their way out at the most unexpected times, and I’m holding onto the possibility of that for you.”
“We’ll also keep your therapist in the loop that you’re in this deep slump. They’ll want to know so they can adjust your treatment or offer additional support (maybe a med adjustment or more frequent sessions for a bit). You are not going to be left to just drift in this dark place alone.”

Grounding & Stabilization
"Right now, it sounds like you're in a lot of emotional pain. Let's try something together to help you feel a bit more grounded. Can you bring your attention to your feet on the floor? Just notice the sensation of contact, the solid ground beneath you. This quietly reminds your nervous system you're here, right now, and you're safe in this moment."
[Pause, allow them to practice this simple somatic anchor]
"How does that feel? Sometimes when we're overwhelmed, connecting with our body in the present moment can give us a small anchor."

Validating the Pain & Introducing Self-Compassion
"What you're experiencing right now - this hopelessness - it's incredibly painful. I want to acknowledge that. This is a moment of real suffering for you, and that matters."
"Can we try something called a Self-Compassion Break together? First, let's just acknowledge what's true: 'This is a moment of suffering. This really hurts.' Can you say that, either out loud or to yourself?"
[Pause]
"Now, let's remember that suffering is part of the human experience. You're not alone in feeling this way - 'Suffering is a part of life.' Millions of people have felt exactly what you're feeling right now."
"And finally, can you place a hand on your heart and offer yourself some kindness? 'May I be kind to myself in this moment.' You deserve the same compassion you'd give a good friend who was hurting."

Creating Distance from Hopeless Thoughts
"I'm hearing thoughts like '[repeat their specific hopeless thoughts].' Those thoughts feel very real and very true right now. Let's try something - can you add this phrase in front: 'I'm having the thought that...' So instead of 'Nothing will ever get better,' it becomes 'I'm having the thought that nothing will ever get better.'"
"Do you notice any difference when we say it that way? Sometimes adding that phrase can create just a little space between you and the thought, helping you see it as a mental event rather than an absolute truth."

Radical Acceptance of Current Reality
"Right now, you're in pain, and that's the reality we're working with. I know you didn't choose this, and it's not fair. Radical acceptance doesn't mean we like what's happening or that we're giving up. It means we stop fighting the reality of this moment so we can use our energy for coping and moving forward."
"Can you say with me: 'This is what I'm experiencing right now. I cannot change that this is happening, but I can choose how I respond to it.'"

Exploring Protective Parts
"It sounds like there might be a part of you that's trying to protect you from more disappointment by believing that nothing will get better. Let's get curious about that part. From a place of compassion, can we ask that part: 'What are you trying to protect me from? What are you afraid would happen if you allowed yourself to hope?'"
[Allow them to explore this]
"That part developed for good reasons - to keep you safe from more pain. Can we thank that part for trying to protect you, while also letting it know that complete hopelessness might not be the only way to stay safe?"

Behavioral Activation Through Opposite Action
"I notice the hopelessness is telling you to [isolate/give up/withdraw]. While that urge makes sense, I'm wondering if acting on it is actually helping you feel better or if it might be keeping you stuck."
"What if we tried the opposite? Instead of [their avoidance behavior], what would be the opposite action? Maybe [suggest small, manageable opposite action]. We don't have to do anything big - just one small step in the opposite direction."

Externalizing the Hopelessness
"It sounds like 'The Hopelessness' has been really loud lately, telling you that nothing matters and nothing will change. What else is The Hopelessness telling you?"
"By thinking of it as 'The Hopelessness' rather than 'me,' we can get some distance. You are not your hopelessness - you are a person who is currently experiencing hopelessness. There's a difference."

Cognitive Reframing & Future Focus
"I hear you saying things like 'I'm worthless' or 'I'm broken.' Let's pause there. Is it more accurate to say 'I'm going through an incredibly difficult time right now'? One suggests something permanent and global about who you are. The other describes a temporary experience you're having."
"Even though it feels like this pain will last forever, feelings - even intense ones like this - are temporary. They change. You've felt differently before, which means you can feel differently again."

Closing & Resource Connection
"You've shown incredible strength by reaching out today and staying on this call with me. That tells me something important about who you are, even when you can't see it right now."
"Before we end, let's make sure you have some support in place. Do you have someone you can reach out to today? And here's the number for the crisis line [provide number] - you can call anytime, 24/7."
"What's one small thing you can do to take care of yourself in the next few hours? It doesn't have to be big - maybe drinking some water, taking a shower, or texting one person who cares about you."
"Remember, you don't have to feel hopeful right now. You just have to be willing to stay here and take the next right step. And you've already done that by calling today."
End on Compassion
“Even if you can’t feel hope right now, I have enough for both of us. I know you’re tired. But you’ve made it to this day, even carrying all that despair – that’s not small thing. That shows a spark of strength in you. I believe in that part of you, even if you feel like it’s gone. I promise to hang in here with you. You’re not burdensome or wasting my time – I’m here because I care. We’ll take this one step at a time, together.”

🟨 Terminal Illness
Initial Response & Presence
"Thank you for reaching out today. I can only imagine how overwhelming this must be for you right now. Having a terminal diagnosis brings up so many intense feelings and fears. I'm here with you in this moment, and I want you to know that whatever you're feeling right now is completely valid and understandable."
[Pause, allow silence, demonstrate presence]
"Before we continue, I need to check in about your safety. Sometimes when people are facing a terminal illness, they have thoughts about wanting to control how or when they die. Are you having any thoughts about hurting yourself or ending your life?"
[If yes: Follow safety protocol with sensitivity to their medical situation] [If no: Continue with supportive presence]

Immediate Grounding & Stabilization
"Right now, you might be feeling completely overwhelmed by thoughts about the future, about dying, about all the unknowns. Let's bring you back to this moment, right here, right now."
"Can you feel your body in the chair or bed where you're sitting? Notice that right now, in this moment, you're breathing. You're here. You're alive right now."
"Let's try some gentle breathing together. Not to fix anything, but just to anchor you in the present. Breathe in slowly... and out slowly. Just focusing on this breath, then the next one."
"Place a hand on your heart if you can. Feel your heartbeat. This is your life force, still strong, still here with you right now."

Validating the Enormity of Their Experience
"What you're going through - facing your own mortality - this is one of the most profound and difficult human experiences. There's no right way to feel about this. Whether you're feeling scared, angry, sad, numb, or all of these at once, it all makes sense."
"This diagnosis has likely changed everything - how you see your future, your relationships, your daily life. That's a tremendous amount to process, and it's okay if you feel completely overwhelmed."
"Some people think they should be 'brave' or 'positive' all the time when facing terminal illness. But you're allowed to feel however you feel. You're allowed to have bad days, to be angry, to grieve."

Radical Acceptance of an Unchangeable Reality
"Right now, you might be fighting against this reality - the reality of your diagnosis, of limited time, of things being out of your control. That fighting is so natural and human. And it's also exhausting."
"Radical acceptance doesn't mean liking what's happening or giving up hope for treatments or good days. It means acknowledging what is true: 'This is my diagnosis. This is what I'm facing. I cannot change this reality.'"
"What would it feel like to stop fighting against what you cannot change, so you can put your energy toward what you can still influence - how you spend your time, who you connect with, what matters most to you?"
"Can you say with me: 'I cannot change my diagnosis, but I can choose how I live with it'?"

Acknowledging Protector Parts
"There might be parts of you right now that are working overtime - maybe a part that's trying to stay strong for others, or a part that's desperately searching for ways to fight this, or a part that's shutting down to protect you from the pain."
"Let's get curious about these parts with compassion. What is the part that's trying to stay strong afraid would happen if you let people see your fear? What is the part that's searching for solutions trying to protect you from?"
[Allow exploration]
"Can we thank these parts for trying to protect you, while also acknowledging that they might be working so hard that they're exhausting you? Maybe we can let them know it's okay to rest sometimes."

Separating Fear from Present Reality
"I'm hearing a lot of fear about the future - about pain, about dying, about leaving loved ones behind. These fears make complete sense. But let's separate fear from what's actually happening right now."
"Fear is telling you stories about how terrible everything will be. But fear isn't a reliable narrator - it always predicts the worst-case scenario. Let's look at what's actually true right now, in this moment."
"Right now, are you in unbearable pain? Right now, are you alone? Right now, are you dying? Or right now, are you talking with me, breathing, present in this moment?"
"When the fear stories get loud, can you come back to: 'Right now, I am okay. Right now, I am here. I can handle right now.'"

Self-Compassion in the Face of Mortality
"Facing terminal illness can bring up so much self-judgment - 'I should be braver,' 'I should be more grateful for the time I have,' 'I shouldn't be such a burden.' Let's address that harsh inner voice."
"What you're going through is one of the hardest things a human can face. You deserve infinite compassion right now, especially from yourself. Let's try a self-compassion break."
"Can you acknowledge: 'This is a moment of profound suffering. Facing death is incredibly difficult.' Then connect to our shared humanity: 'Every human being will face mortality. I'm not alone in this fear.'"
"Now, with your hand on your heart, can you offer yourself kindness: 'May I be gentle with myself. May I treat myself with the tenderness I'd show someone I love who was facing what I'm facing.'"

Meaning-Making and Values Clarification
"When we're facing limited time, it can help to get clear about what matters most. Not in a pressured way, but in a way that helps you focus your precious energy on what's truly important to you."
"If you think about the time you have - whether it's months or years - what do you most want that time to include? How do you want to spend your energy? What relationships matter most?"
"What would it look like to live in alignment with your deepest values, even while facing this diagnosis? What would 'living well' mean to you in this situation?"
"You still have choices. You still have some control over how you spend your days, who you see, what you focus on. That agency is still yours."

Addressing Anticipatory Grief
"You might be grieving already - grieving the future you thought you'd have, the things you won't get to do, the time you won't have with loved ones. This anticipatory grief is completely normal and valid."
"You're allowed to mourn what you're losing. You're allowed to be angry about it. You're allowed to feel cheated or scared or devastated. These feelings don't make you ungrateful - they make you human."
"Grief and gratitude can exist at the same time. You can be heartbroken about leaving your family and also grateful for the love you've shared. Both can be true."

Opposite Action for Isolation
"Terminal illness can make you want to withdraw - to protect others from your pain, or to avoid being a burden, or because you feel like damaged goods. While that urge makes sense, isolation often makes the emotional pain worse."
"What would be the opposite of withdrawing? Maybe reaching out to one person who matters to you, or accepting help when it's offered, or letting someone sit with you in your fear instead of carrying it alone."
"The people who love you want to be with you through this, not just when you're feeling strong. Your vulnerability gives them the gift of being able to love and support you."

Cognitive Defusion from Catastrophic Thoughts
"I'm hearing thoughts like 'I'm going to die in agony' or 'My family will never recover from losing me.' These thoughts feel absolutely true and terrifying right now. Let's try something."
"Can you add this phrase: 'I'm having the thought that...' or 'My fear is telling me that...' So 'I'm going to die in agony' becomes 'I'm having the fearful thought that I'm going to die in agony.'"
"Do you notice any difference? These are fear thoughts, not necessarily facts about your future. Fear always shows us the worst-case scenario, but that doesn't make it accurate."

Finding Peace with Uncertainty
"One of the hardest parts of terminal illness is not knowing - not knowing how much time, not knowing how it will go, not knowing what comes after. The uncertainty can feel unbearable."
"But here's what I know: uncertainty has always been part of life. None of us ever really knew how much time we had. Your diagnosis has just made that uncertainty more visible."
"What would it feel like to make peace with not knowing? To say, 'I don't know what's coming, and I can live with not knowing. I can find meaning and connection even in the midst of uncertainty.'"

Legacy and Connection
"Sometimes when people are facing terminal illness, they worry that they'll be forgotten or that their life didn't matter enough. Can we talk about the impact you've had on the people around you?"
"What do you hope people will remember about you? What love have you given that will continue to live in others' hearts? What wisdom or kindness have you shared that has made a difference?"
"Your life has created ripples that will continue long after you're gone. The love you've given, the ways you've helped others, the moments of joy you've shared - those don't disappear."

Practical Coping for Right Now
"Let's focus on getting through today, this week. What's one small thing that brings you comfort or peace? Maybe listening to music, being in nature, connecting with someone you love?"
"When the fear gets overwhelming, what's one thing you can do to bring yourself back to the present moment? Maybe the breathing we did, or looking at something beautiful, or feeling someone's hand in yours?"
"Who are the people in your support system right now? Who can you call when the fear gets too big to carry alone? You don't have to face this by yourself."

Spiritual/Existential Comfort (if appropriate)
"Different people find comfort in different places when facing mortality. Some find it in their faith, some in nature, some in the love they've shared. What, if anything, brings you a sense of peace or larger meaning?"
[Follow their lead - don't impose spiritual beliefs]
"Many people facing terminal illness find that love is what matters most in the end - the love they've given and received. That love doesn't die with the body."

Closing with Presence and Hope
"Thank you for trusting me with your fears and your pain today. What you're facing takes incredible courage, and you don't have to be brave every moment. You're allowed to be scared and sad and angry."
"You are not alone in this. There are people who love you, professionals who can support you, and communities of others who understand what you're going through."
"What's one thing you can do to take care of yourself today? Maybe something small that brings you comfort or connects you with what you love?"
"Remember, you're still here. You still have today. That matters. You matter."
"Here are some resources that might help [provide hospice resources, support groups, spiritual care if requested]. The crisis line at [number] is available 24/7 if you need someone to talk to."
"You don't have to carry this alone. There are people trained to walk alongside you through this journey."

🟨 Obsessive-Compulsive Thoughts
(Client is distressed by unwanted obsessive thoughts or urges (e.g., fears of contamination, needing to check things repeatedly) but is not in immediate panic, just anxious and frustrated by them.)
Normalize the Experience
“It sounds like your brain is stuck on a loop right now. Those kinds of intrusive thoughts can be really exhausting and frightening. You’re not crazy – OCD-type thoughts happen to a lot of people, and they don’t reflect your character or true intentions.”
“The fact that these thoughts upset you tells me you’re a good person. People often get the most upset by thoughts that go against their values. So an intrusive thought about [hurting someone or something ‘bad’] doesn’t mean you want to do it; it means the opposite – it bothers you because you don’t want to do it.”
Create a Bit of Distance from the Thought
“Try thinking of the thought as just a symptom or even like a bully in your head. You can give it a nickname if you want, like ‘oh, there goes Mr. OCD nagging me again.’ Sometimes if you treat the thought like an annoying background music, you can let it play without giving it full attention.”
“Instead of saying ‘I’m going to [bad thing]’ in your head, reframe it as ‘I have a thought that I might [bad thing].’ See how that’s a step away from it? It’s not you, it’s a thought you’re observing. It’s like a cloud passing by rather than who you are.”
Avoid Arguing with the Thought (Minimize Compulsions)
“I know you feel like you have to [check or perform a compulsion] to make the anxiety go down. And it might give you a brief relief, but then the cycle starts again, right? What if we try to ride out the anxiety without doing the ritual just for a short time – say 5 minutes – and see if it starts to drop on its own?”
“The goal (in the long run) is to teach your brain that nothing terrible happens even if you don’t do the compulsion. But we can go gradually. Maybe delay the next check by a tiny bit, and use that time to do some breathing or listen to a song, then check. Over time, you can stretch that gap more.”
Coping Statements
“When the thought hits, you might tell yourself: ‘This is just my OCD talking. I don’t have to take it so seriously. It’s just a false alarm.’ Or ‘My brain is playing a trick on me, I don’t have to respond as if it’s real danger.’”
“Remind yourself: ‘Thoughts are not actions. Having a thought doesn’t make it true and doesn’t make it happen.’”
Breathing and Grounding
“Let’s do a quick breathing exercise to dial back the anxiety that these thoughts are causing. Inhale for 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6... Good. A few more times. We want to engage your rational brain a bit more so it can recognize the thought for what it is – just a thought.”
“Sometimes even engaging your brain in a different task can help break the loop. Could you try doing a quick math problem in your head when the thought hits, or describe your surroundings in detail? It forces your brain to switch gears, even if briefly.”
Plan for Therapy Work
“It might help to tell your therapist or psychiatrist about this if you haven’t – OCD is something that can really improve with the right techniques (like Exposure and Response Prevention therapy or sometimes medication). You don’t have to white-knuckle this forever. There are tools for it.”
“For now, remember: you’re not your thoughts. You’re the observer of these thoughts, and you can learn to let them pass without giving them so much power. It won’t be perfect, and that’s okay. Even noticing that a thought is ‘an OCD thought’ is a victory of awareness.”
Praise Effort
“You just told me about something that probably feels really embarrassing or scary to admit. That’s a huge step. I want you to recognize that – you challenged the OCD by exposing it to me. That’s actually part of getting better: not keeping it a secret. You did that. I’m proud of you for sharing it.”
“Every time you resist doing a compulsion or even delay it, you’re retraining your brain. It might not feel like it in the moment, but you’re building strength. We’ll keep working on this together. You’re not alone and you’re definitely not crazy – I understand what’s happening and I’ll support you through it.”
🟨 Negative Thought Loops / Rumination
(Client is stuck in a cycle of negative thinking or replaying something over and over (“What if...”, “I should have...”).)
Gently Interrupt the Rumination
“I notice your mind keeps circling around this. It’s like you’re stuck in a thought loop, huh? That can be really draining. Let’s hit the pause button on those thoughts for just a moment, if we can.”
“Imagine a huge red stop sign or hear a loud buzzer – something to break that circuit in your brain. Sometimes I even snap my fingers once (snap) – like that – to signal a reset. Okay, now take a breath. Good.”
Externalize the Thoughts
“Can you see these thoughts as like a radio playing in the background? They’re noisy, but you can also step back and just observe them. What if you give your mind permission to shelve these worries for just a few minutes? Maybe tell yourself: ‘I know you want to think about this, brain, but let’s take 5 minutes off.’”
“Another trick: set aside a specific ‘worry time’ later. For example, decide that at 7pm you’ll allow yourself 15 minutes to worry and ruminate all you want. But until then, when a rumination starts, you say ‘Not now, I have you scheduled for later.’ It sounds silly, but it can actually train your mind to not bombard you constantly.”
Reality-Check Gently
“You keep replaying what happened and blaming yourself (or worrying about what might happen). Let’s test some of those thoughts. For instance, you think ‘I completely messed everything up.’ Is that 100% true? Or are you focusing only on the negatives? Maybe something went wrong, but did some things also go okay or at least not catastrophically?”
“If it’s a ‘what if’ loop about the future: What evidence do we have that the worst-case scenario will happen? And if it did, what could you do? Sometimes outlining a plan for the worst-case actually quiets the mind, because it knows you’re prepared. And often, the worst-case doesn’t happen.”
Encourage Present Focus
“Let’s ground for a minute in the here and now. Feel your feet on the floor. Look around and name two colors you see. Listen – what’s one sound you hear? Just to remind your brain that right now, in this moment, nothing disastrous is happening. Often rumination is about the past or future. In the present, you are safe.”
“Try to engage in an activity that forces your attention elsewhere. Maybe after we talk, you can do something that fully absorbs you – like a puzzle, or a game, or cooking, or a workout. It’s hard for the brain to ruminate when you’re physically or mentally busy with a task.”
Self-Compassion
“You’re really beating yourself up in this mental loop. Would you talk to a friend the way you’re talking to yourself internally? Likely not. Try to give yourself a fraction of the understanding you’d give someone else. You’re only human; humans have limits and make mistakes and can’t predict everything.”
“Even if you made a mistake or even a few, running it in your head 1,000 times won’t change it. Let’s see if together we can extract a lesson from it and then let the replay go. What did you learn from this situation? If you can identify one takeaway, then maybe we can tell your brain, ‘Thanks, we got the lesson, we don’t need to watch the rerun anymore.’”
Plan
“Next time you catch yourself in a rumination spiral, notice it and label it: ‘I’m ruminating.’ Sometimes just calling it out can give you a little distance. Then try a disruption: stand up, stretch, drink water, name objects in the room, something to break the chain.”
“We can also tell your therapist that this is a big issue; there are cognitive-behavioral techniques specifically to handle rumination and worry. You might work on those in your sessions. But for now, let’s aim for small victories: maybe you can reduce a 2-hour rumination to 1 hour, or catch yourself half-way and come back to the present for a bit. Progress, not perfection.”
Encouragement
“The fact that you recognize you’re stuck in a thought loop is a good sign. It means you have insight and you’re not completely convinced by these thoughts – part of you is saying, ‘This is too much.’ That’s healthy. We’re going to nurture that part of you that can step back. I know it’s tiring, but with practice, you’ll be able to unhook from these loops more easily.”
“You’re doing well. Even talking about your thought patterns instead of just being trapped in them is a step forward. It shows you’re working on it. Keep in mind, you’ve survived every bad thought your mind has thrown at you so far – you’re stronger than these loops. We’ll keep working on breaking them.”

🟨 Eating Disorder (Moderate)
(Client is exhibiting some disordered eating behaviors or thoughts – skipping meals, obsessing over calories, or occasional binge/purge – and is distressed, but not in medical crisis. Focus on encouraging healthier behavior and reducing shame.)
Address the Elephant Gently
“You mentioned some concerns around eating and body image. I know that can be really sensitive to talk about. I just want to say: I’m here to support you, not judge you. A lot of people struggle with food and eating; you’re definitely not alone in that.”
“It sounds like food and your body have become sources of anxiety (or control) for you. That’s actually pretty common – when life feels chaotic, sometimes people focus on food or weight because it’s something they feel they can control. Does that resonate at all with you?”
Encourage Small Nourishment
“Your body needs nutrition, even if part of your mind is telling you it doesn’t deserve it or you’ll feel better if you skip. Those thoughts are lying to you, as convincing as they are. You don’t have to earn food – you need it, like oxygen.”
Address Purge/Binge if relevant (without horror)
“You shared that you ended up [binging/vomiting/laxative use]. I’m sorry you’re going through that. I know afterwards can come a lot of guilt or physical discomfort. How are you feeling now?”
“Our goal is to help you find other ways to cope so you don’t have to hurt yourself through food. But for now, let’s make sure you’re physically okay. Did you drink some water after? Can you be gentle with yourself for the rest of the day – like maybe rest, avoid triggers if possible?”
Separate Identity from ED
“I want you to know: I see you – not just the eating issues. You’re a whole person, and this is something you’re struggling with, not the entirety of who you are. You’re not ‘broken’ or ‘bad’ because of this. It’s a coping mechanism that’s gotten out of hand, and that can happen to anyone.”
“Shame often fuels the cycle. So let’s dump the shame right here. You’re taking steps by even admitting this to me – that’s incredibly brave.”
Involve Professional Help (if not already)
“Eating concerns can be really tough to beat on your own. This will be important to continue working on in your therapy sessions. I can bring this to your therapist if you’re comfortable with that.”
Positive Reinforcement
“You ate something small yesterday even though you felt like restricting – that’s a huge victory. Seriously, I want you to acknowledge how hard that was and that you did it. Little wins like that are what recovery is built on.”
“And the fact that you’re talking about it now – not hiding it – is a sign you’re looking for change. That’s a big deal. I’m proud of you for that.”
Plan/Commitment
“What’s one thing you think you can manage today or tomorrow to care for your body? It could be as simple as drinking a glass of water when you wake up, or eating a protein bar even if you skip a full meal, or not weighing yourself for one day. Let’s set a very gentle, achievable goal that won’t freak out that part of you that wants control, but will still be a step toward health.”
“Would you agree to that? And if you stumble, no beating yourself up – we just try again. Recovery is not linear and slip-ups don’t erase the progress.”
Assurance
“I know this is scary. But you’re not alone in it. We care about you – I care about you – and we want you healthy and happy. You deserve to nourish yourself and to live without this burden. It won’t magically get solved overnight, but inch by inch, we’ll work on it together. You’ve got this, even when it feels like you don’t.”

🟨 Neurodivergent Challenges (ADHD/Autism Spectrum)
(Client is struggling with aspects of neurodivergence – e.g., feeling overwhelmed by stimuli, trouble focusing, feeling misunderstood socially – and is moderately distressed.)
Validate Their Experience
“It sounds like your brain works a bit differently, and that can be really challenging in a world that isn’t designed for that. I hear you saying how [overwhelming the noise is, how hard it is to focus, how confusing social situations are]. That’s absolutely a valid struggle – it’s not ‘in your head’ in the dismissive way; it’s your real experience.”
“There’s nothing wrong or lesser about being neurodivergent. Your brain just processes things uniquely. It might make some things harder, but it probably also gives you strengths (like creativity, hyper-focus in areas of interest, unique perspectives). We can work on managing the hard parts together.”
Immediate Coping for Sensory Overload (if relevant)
“Are the lights or sounds bothering you right now? We can dim the lights, or if you want, you can wear headphones or a hoodie to feel more comfortable. No judgment – do what you need to regulate.”
“If you feel like you’re getting overwhelmed, let me know and we can take a break or do a calming exercise. Maybe take 5 deep breaths or do a quick body scan, whatever helps reset when your senses are overloaded.”
Communication Preferences
“If I ever explain something or say something that isn’t clear, please tell me. I know sometimes it’s hard to read between the lines or handle too many instructions at once. I can communicate more directly or break things down step by step – honestly, that often helps everyone, not just neurodivergent folks.”
“Also, if eye contact is hard or fidgeting helps you concentrate, feel free. You don’t have to force eye contact with me or sit still if that’s uncomfortable. I understand you can listen and think while fiddling with something or looking away.”
Address Social Feelings
“You mentioned feeling misunderstood socially or not sure how to connect. That can be really painful, feeling like the ‘odd one out.’ I want you to know, the right people will appreciate you as you are. It might be a smaller circle, but quality matters more than quantity with friends.”
“Maybe we can brainstorm one or two people who do get you (or could get you). Or communities – there are lots of neurodivergent communities online where people share tips and just vent. That could help you feel less alone in this.”
Problem-Solve Focus/Organization (if ADHD issues)
“For the focus and organization difficulties: have you ever tried writing things down as checklists, or setting timers for tasks? Sometimes externalizing the reminders can help since ADHD brains aren’t great at internal clocks or memory for boring tasks.”
“We could also talk to your therapist or doctor about this. If you haven’t been evaluated for ADHD or you want to revisit it, maybe medication or coaching or accommodations could help. There’s no shame in using tools to help your brain do what it needs to do.”
Encourage Self-Acceptance
“I know you sometimes feel like you’re ‘too weird’ or ‘broken’ because of how your brain works. You’re not. You’re different, yes, and different can be hard, but it can also be powerful. Many of the most innovative thinkers are neurodivergent. You might just experience and see the world in a way others don’t – that’s not inherently bad, even if it feels like it when you’re judged for it.”
“Try to remember that when you’re struggling: it’s not that you’re failing at being ‘normal,’ it’s that the environment isn’t a great fit. With tweaks and supports (like noise-cancelling headphones, routines, understanding friends), you can thrive.”
Practical Step
“What’s one thing that would make tomorrow a tiny bit easier for you regarding this? Maybe laying out clothes tonight if mornings are hard, or telling your roommate that you need the living room quiet at a certain time, or putting your keys by the door so you don’t lose them. Let’s pick a small adjustment to implement.”
“Also, I highly encourage celebrating your wins. If you manage to focus for 10 minutes and get something done, or you navigate a social interaction without feeling awful, give yourself credit. Those aren’t small things – they’re achievements.”
Affirmation
“There is nothing wrong with how your brain works; it’s just different. And different can be hard, but also beautiful. I admire how you’ve learned to cope so far and how self-aware you are about your needs. That’s a strength. We’ll keep finding strategies and I’ll be here to support you. You’re not alone – and you have every right to advocate for what you need to make your world more comfortable for you.”

🟨 Off-Topic / Distractible (Difficulty Staying Focused)
(Client frequently goes off on tangents or changes subject to avoid emotional topics, or struggles to stay on point, in a moderate way that hinders progress.)
Kindly Refocus
“I notice we jumped to a different topic just now. That’s okay – sometimes our brains steer us away when we hit something uncomfortable or just because something else pops up. Let’s gently steer back to what we were talking about earlier, because I think that was important.”
“Earlier you were telling me about how you felt when your mother said that comment. I want to make sure we address that, because it seemed to really hurt you. Is it alright if we go back to that for a bit?”
Explore Avoidance if Present
“Sometimes when we start talking about tough stuff, it’s tempting to change the subject – even without noticing – because it’s hard to face. If you think that might be happening, let me know. We can take it slower or take a break if needed. I won’t force you to talk about something you’re not ready to.”
“At the same time, I do want to gently hold us to the task, because you came here to work on these issues and I want to respect that goal. So how about we agree: if you go off-topic and I suspect it’s avoidance, I’ll kindly point it out and you have the right to say ‘not right now’ if you truly don’t want to go there today. Does that sound okay?”
Address Distractibility (if cognitive)
“I can see you have a lot on your mind, and it’s totally fine to cover many things. However, we have limited time, so let’s prioritize. What’s the most important thing you want to focus on today? Let’s write that down, and if we stray, we can glance at it to remember.”
“If focusing is hard, we can also implement some structure. Would it help if I summarized what I’m hearing every so often, or if we make a short list of topics to stick to?”
Encourage Mindfulness
“Let’s pause for a second and just breathe together. Try to clear your mind of all those other threads tugging at you. We’re just here, right now, talking about [the main topic]. If another thought comes up, imagine gently placing it in a box to the side – you can always open it later – and bring your attention back here.”
“It’s totally human to get distracted. The fact that you notice it means we can manage it. No judgment – think of me as a gentle guide, nudging you back on the path when you wander.”
Acknowledge the Tangent (if valuable)
“What you brought up about your work stress – that’s also important. I wonder, could it be related to what we were discussing about your anxiety? If it’s okay with you, maybe we incorporate that after we finish the thread we were on. I’ll make a note so we definitely address it.”
“Okay, I jotted down ‘work stress’ so I won’t forget. How about we spend the next 10 minutes on the original issue (your mother’s comment), then we’ll switch and give some time to the work thing? Would that feel fair?”
Positive Reinforcement
“You’re doing great. We covered the tough bit about your mom’s comment after all, and I really appreciate you sticking with that. I know it’s tempting to veer away, but you stayed with it. That’s progress!”
“And it’s not that going off-topic is ‘bad’ – sometimes it’s how we discover other important things. But I’m glad we circled back so you got what you needed out of this session.”
Closing
“Just to recap: we managed to tackle that sensitive issue and also touched on your work stress a bit. If you notice yourself feeling all over the place during the week, remember the little strategy we used: jot down tangential thoughts to return to later, and gently remind yourself of what you’re focusing on now. It might help keep you on track when you need to be.”
“We’ll keep practicing this focus together. No worries – I’m here to help reel things in whenever it gets too scattered. It’s a team effort. You bring the thoughts, and I’ll help organize them so we can deal with them one by one.”


🟨 Infidelity
Immediate Stabilization & Grounding
"What you've discovered is a major shock to your system. Your body and mind are probably feeling like they're in crisis mode right now - racing thoughts, maybe physical symptoms like nausea or shaking. That's completely normal when our world gets turned upside down like this."
"Let's try to help your nervous system settle just a little bit so we can think more clearly. Can you bring your attention to your feet on the floor? Feel the solid ground beneath you. Right now, in this moment, you are safe."
"Let's try some breathing together. Your body is probably holding a lot of stress right now. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts... hold for 4... and out for 6 counts. This longer exhale helps calm your nervous system."
[Breathe with them for several cycles]

Validating the Crisis Response
"What you're feeling right now - the shock, the anger, the hurt, maybe feeling like your whole world has been shaken - all of that makes complete sense. Discovering infidelity is a form of trauma. Your reaction is normal and valid."
"This isn't just about the cheating itself - it's about trust being broken, your sense of security being shattered, and maybe questioning everything you thought you knew about your relationship and your partner."
"There's no 'right' way to respond to this. Some people feel numb, some feel rage, some feel devastated. Whatever you're feeling right now is okay."

Immediate Safety Planning
"Right now, we need to think about your immediate safety and stability. Are you currently at home with your partner? Do you feel physically and emotionally safe there?"
[If they're with partner and feeling unsafe, help create safety plan] [If they're alone, assess their support system]
"Do you have somewhere safe you can stay tonight if you need space? A friend, family member, or other support person you could reach out to?"
"What do you need most right now in terms of immediate support? Someone to talk to, a place to stay, help making decisions about next steps?"

Managing Overwhelming Emotions
"The emotions you're experiencing right now might feel completely overwhelming. That's normal - betrayal creates a flood of different feelings all at once. Anger, hurt, confusion, maybe even relief if you suspected something."
"Let's try to create a little space between you and these intense emotions. When you notice yourself getting flooded, you can remind yourself: 'I'm having very intense feelings about a very painful situation. These feelings are valid, and they will change.'"
"Right now, you don't have to make any big decisions. You don't have to figure out the future of your relationship today. You just need to get through this moment, then the next one."

Acknowledging Protective Parts
"There might be different parts of you responding to this crisis. Maybe there's a part that's furious and wants to lash out, a part that's heartbroken and wants to disappear, or a part that's trying to figure out how to fix this or make sense of it all."
"Can we acknowledge these different parts with compassion? Each part is trying to protect you in its own way. The angry part might be trying to defend your dignity. The hurt part is grieving what's been lost. The problem-solving part is trying to regain control."
"All of these parts make sense. You don't have to choose just one way to feel about this."

Reality vs. Crisis Thinking
"When we're in crisis, our thinking can become very black and white, very catastrophic. Your mind might be spinning with thoughts like 'My life is ruined,' 'I'll never trust anyone again,' or 'This is all my fault.'"
"Let's try adding this phrase to those thoughts: 'Right now, I'm having the crisis thought that...' So 'My life is ruined' becomes 'Right now, I'm having the crisis thought that my life is ruined.'"
"These thoughts feel absolutely true right now, but they're crisis thoughts - they're your mind's way of trying to process trauma. We don't have to believe everything our crisis mind is telling us."

Self-Compassion in Crisis
"Right now, there might be a voice in your head blaming you - wondering what you did wrong, why you weren't enough, how you missed the signs. That self-blame is common, but it's not helpful and it's not accurate."
"Let's try a self-compassion break. First, acknowledge the pain: 'This is a moment of tremendous suffering. This betrayal is incredibly painful.' You don't have to minimize it."
"Second, remember you're not alone: 'Many people have experienced betrayal like this. I'm not the only person who has ever felt this pain.'"
"Third, with your hand on your heart, offer yourself kindness: 'May I be gentle with myself during this crisis. May I treat myself with the same compassion I'd show a dear friend going through this.'"

Radical Acceptance of the Crisis
"Right now, you might be fighting against the reality of what's happened - 'This can't be real,' 'This can't be happening,' 'How do I make this not be true?' That fight against reality is understandable, but it creates additional suffering."
"Radical acceptance doesn't mean you're okay with what happened or that you approve of it. It means acknowledging the reality: 'My partner cheated. This is what happened. I cannot change what has already occurred.'"
"Fighting reality takes enormous energy that you need for coping and deciding what comes next. What would it feel like to stop fighting against what's already happened and focus that energy on taking care of yourself?"
Immediate vs. Long-term Decisions
"You might be feeling pressure to make big decisions right now - whether to leave, whether to forgive, whether to confront your partner, whether to tell others. But you're in crisis mode, and crisis mode isn't the best time for life-changing decisions."
"What are the decisions you absolutely have to make today for your immediate safety and well-being? Everything else can wait until you're more stabilized."
"It's okay to say 'I don't know what I want to do about our relationship yet, and I don't have to decide that today.' Your only job right now is to take care of yourself through this crisis."

Managing Rumination and Obsessive Thoughts
"Your mind is probably spinning - replaying conversations, looking for signs you missed, imagining scenarios, planning confrontations. That's your brain's way of trying to make sense of something that doesn't make sense."
"When you notice your mind spinning, you can try this: 'I notice I'm ruminating about [specific thought]. This is my mind trying to solve an unsolvable problem. I can choose to redirect my attention to something I can actually control right now.'"
"What's one thing you can control right now? Maybe drinking some water, calling a friend, taking a shower, or going for a short walk. Small acts of self-care are acts of control when everything else feels chaotic."

Support System Activation
"Crisis is not a time to be alone. Who are the safest, most supportive people in your life? Who would you want to know about this, and who could offer you practical or emotional support?"
"You don't have to tell everyone everything, but isolation will make this crisis harder. Even just having one person who knows what you're going through can make a difference."
"What kind of support do you need most right now? Someone to listen, someone to help you think through options, someone to just be with you, or someone to help with practical matters?"

Opposite Action for Crisis Urges
"Crisis creates strong urges - maybe to confront your partner immediately, to make dramatic decisions, to isolate, to engage in behaviors that might make you feel worse later. Let's think about this."
"What is the crisis urging you to do right now? ... Now, what would be the opposite of that urge? Instead of [crisis urge], what if you [opposite action]?"
"We're not talking about doing nothing or avoiding the situation forever. We're talking about not letting crisis emotions drive actions that you might regret when you're thinking more clearly."

Immediate Coping Plan
"Let's create a plan for getting through the next 24 hours. What do you need to do to take care of your basic needs - eating, sleeping, staying safe?"
"What helps you feel most grounded when you're overwhelmed? Maybe it's talking to someone, being in nature, listening to music, physical movement?"
"If the crisis feelings get overwhelming again today, what's one thing you can do? Maybe call this crisis line again, use the breathing technique we practiced, or reach out to your support person?"

Maintaining Dignity and Self-Respect
"In the midst of this crisis, it's important to act in ways that align with who you want to be. When you look back on how you handled this crisis, how do you want to remember responding?"
"This doesn't mean being perfect or never feeling angry. It means making choices that preserve your dignity and self-respect, even when you're in tremendous pain."
"Your partner's choices are about them. Your choices in response are about you. You get to decide who you want to be in this crisis."

Closing & Resource Connection
"You've shown incredible strength by reaching out during this crisis instead of suffering alone. That tells me something important about your resilience, even when you can't feel it right now."
"Discovering infidelity is traumatic, and healing from betrayal takes time. You don't have to have it all figured out today. You just have to take care of yourself moment by moment."
"What's one thing you're going to do to take care of yourself in the next few hours? Something small but nurturing?"
"Here are some resources that might help [provide domestic violence hotline if relevant, local support groups, crisis line number]. Remember, you can call our crisis line anytime, 24/7."
"Before we end, let's ground together one more time. Feel your feet on the floor, take three deep breaths with me, and remember - you will get through this crisis. You don't have to do it alone."

💚 Green Zone – Growth & Skill-Building 
(Client is relatively stable or calm. Focus on personal growth, developing new skills, reinforcing positive coping and progress. Sessions in this zone often involve optimism, planning, and exploration when the client is ready for deeper engagement and self-improvement.)
💚 Political/Global Events Anxiety
(Client is distressed by news, politics, or global issues – climate change, pandemics, social unrest – feeling overwhelmed and helpless.)
Validate Global Anxiety
“It’s completely understandable to feel anxious and overwhelmed by what’s happening in the world. There’s a lot going on, and it can definitely weigh on one person’s shoulders. You’re not overreacting – these issues are big and they do affect us.”
“Many people are feeling what you’re feeling about [climate change/ current events]. It’s sometimes called ‘headline stress’ or ‘eco-anxiety’ (if climate-related). You’re not alone in that.”
Focus on Control vs. Concern
“One thing that can help is to separate what you can control from what you can’t. We can’t single-handedly solve [the big issue] overnight, but we can control some actions in our own lives or communities. Focusing on small, concrete actions can turn some of that helplessness into empowerment.”
“For example, if climate change is the worry: maybe you decide to volunteer for a local environmental group, or change something in your lifestyle like reducing waste or driving less. If politics is the worry: maybe engaging in local community work or even limiting news intake to certain times so it doesn’t consume you. What’s one thing that comes to mind that you could do, however small?”
Encourage Active Coping
“Sometimes taking action, even tiny ones, can restore a sense of control. It might be donating $5 to a cause, signing a petition, attending a peaceful protest, or simply helping a neighbor. You can’t fix the whole world, but you can improve someone’s world, even if just your own or one person’s.”
“Also, consider channeling your feelings into creating something. Some people write, make art, or compose music about these issues. It’s a way to process that anxiety and turn it into something expressive.”
Set Healthy Boundaries with Media
“How much news are you consuming daily? If it’s a lot, it might be worth setting some boundaries. Maybe choose one reliable news summary a day, and give yourself permission to unplug after that. Constant exposure can amplify anxiety without actually solving anything.”
“It’s not about burying your head in the sand; it’s about protecting your mental health so you don’t burn out. You can stay informed and compassionate and still take breaks. The world’s problems won’t resolve if you worry 24/7 – in fact, you’ll be more effective in doing your part if you’re not in a constant state of panic.”
Ground in Present Goodness
“When the world feels dark, try to notice some good in your immediate surroundings. Are there any positive news stories or community successes you’ve seen? Even something like a neighbor helping another neighbor, or a small kindness you witnessed. The global picture has a lot of bad, but there is good too – it just doesn’t scream as loud as the bad news.”
“Maybe practice gratitude or acknowledgment of small positives daily. It could be as simple as, ‘Today I saw someone hold the door open for an elderly man, which was kind.’ These little observances can remind us humanity isn’t all bad.”
Hope and Efficacy
“The fact that you care so deeply means you have a big heart and a strong sense of justice. That’s a good thing. The world needs people like you who care. Remember, a lot of changes in history started because ordinary people felt exactly like you do and decided to do something in their own corner of the world.”
“I have hope that things can improve, even if slowly. And I see you as part of that hope – because you’re thoughtful and aware. Try to be patient with yourself and the world; change takes time. In the meantime, balance your concern with self-care.”
Commitment to Self-Care
“So, how about this: for each time you read distressing news, you do one kind thing for yourself (or someone else). Read a tough article, then make yourself a nice cup of tea or text a friend to say you care about them. Keep equilibrium. The goal is to stay informed and compassionate without drowning in it.”
“We can also bring this up with your therapist to incorporate into your plan – maybe cognitive techniques to challenge catastrophic thinking, or relaxation techniques when the anxiety spikes. You’re doing the right thing by talking about it rather than just bottling it up.”
Affirmation
“You’re a caring and conscientious person. The fact that global issues upset you is a sign of empathy, not weakness. We just have to make sure that empathy doesn’t turn into paralyzing anxiety. With some boundaries and proactive steps, you can transform some of that worry into meaningful action and also give yourself permission to live your life. You deserve to find moments of peace even as you care about the world.”

💚 Existential Concerns
(Client is grappling with big life questions about meaning, purpose, mortality, the universe – feeling lost or anxious about the point of it all)
Admire Depth and Acknowledge Pain
“These are some of the biggest, most profound questions we face as human beings – meaning, purpose, our place in the world. It makes sense that they feel heavy and even overwhelming. Not everyone has the courage to even voice these thoughts, so I admire you for exploring this.”
“It’s okay not to have easy answers. In fact, most people wrestle with these concerns at some point. You’re definitely not alone in wondering ‘What’s the point?’ or ‘What does it all mean?’”
Validate Feelings of Isolation
“Feeling alone in the universe or like life is meaningless can be incredibly painful. I’m here to sit with that feeling with you. You don’t have to figure it all out today, and you don’t have to face that feeling alone.”
“Sometimes just acknowledging that these questions are hard and there might not be a clear answer can be strangely comforting. It’s like giving yourself permission to not know.”
Explore Values and Sources of Meaning
“When you think about ‘meaning’ or ‘purpose,’ are there any moments or activities in your life that even briefly give you a sense of meaning? It could be as simple as moments in nature, helping a friend, creating something, learning something new... anything that gives you a spark of ‘This matters’.”
“If something comes to mind, maybe that’s a clue to what resonates with you on a deeper level. We can explore how to incorporate more of that into your life.”
“Some people find meaning in relationships, some in creativity, some in serving others, some in personal growth, some in spiritual beliefs. There’s no right or wrong source of meaning – it’s what feels right to you.”
Address Fears of Death or Cosmic Insignificance
“A lot of existential dread comes from realizing our own mortality or how small we are in the vast universe. That can be scary, but it can also be seen another way: If nothing ultimately matters on a cosmic scale, then maybe we’re free to create our own meaning here and now. The pressure is off to do the ‘objective right thing,’ because perhaps the meaning is whatever we choose.”
“Think of it like this: life might be kind of like a blank canvas. That can feel daunting because there’s no pre-drawn picture to follow, but it’s also an opportunity – you get to paint it the way you want. What colors or shapes would you want on your canvas, if you could choose anything that feels fulfilling or beautiful to you?”
Encourage Connection and Wonder
“Sometimes these big questions feel less crushing when we connect with something bigger than ourselves in a positive way – like community, or nature, or spirituality. Is there anything that makes you feel connected or awe-struck in a good way? Maybe looking at the stars, or listening to powerful music, or being part of a volunteer group.”
“Those experiences won’t answer the questions in words, but they might give you a feeling of meaning or belonging, even if you can’t articulate it. It’s like experiencing meaning rather than defining it.”
Emphasize Ongoing Journey
“It’s important to remember that figuring out purpose is often a lifelong journey. It’s okay to be a work in progress. Purposes can change, meanings can evolve. You might find purpose in something now, and in 10 years it could be something else, and that’s okay.”
“Sometimes the search itself is meaningful. Asking these questions means you’re alive and curious. As frustrating as it is, that search is part of what it means to be human.”
Offer Philosophical Perspectives (if appropriate)
“Many philosophers and psychologists have pondered this. For instance, Viktor Frankl, who survived the Holocaust, wrote about finding meaning even in suffering – suggesting that we can choose our attitude and find purpose in how we respond to life. Some people find meaning in love, or in creating, or in experiencing truth or beauty.”
“I could recommend a book or two if you’re interested – like Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning. Not as an answer key, but as a way to see how someone else navigated these questions.”
Closing on Hope
“I firmly believe each person creates their own meaning. The fact that you’re searching tells me you will find pieces of it along the way. Maybe not a grand singular purpose – few people have a single grand mission – but many little purposes that together give your life meaning.”
“We’ll keep exploring this together. In the meantime, focus on what feels meaningful to you, even in small doses. It could be a hobby, relationships, learning, helping others. Those are often where purpose hides out. You might not realize it, but by engaging in those, you could already be living some of your purpose.”
“I have hope for you. Sometimes meaning reveals itself in hindsight, and sometimes in moments. Keep your heart and mind open – I suspect you’ll find more answers as you live through the questions. And as always, I’m here to talk through them whenever you need.”

💚 Chronic Pain or Health Challenges
(Client is dealing with chronic physical pain or a long-term health condition and the emotional toll that comes with it – frustration, depression, anxiety about health.)
Acknowledge the Difficulty
“Dealing with chronic pain (or a chronic illness) is really tough. Not only are you physically hurting, but it wears on you emotionally too. It’s completely valid to feel frustrated, exhausted, or down about it. Anyone in your position would feel that way.”
“It must be so discouraging to wake up and face pain every day (or frequent flare-ups). It’s like running a marathon with no finish line in sight, and you didn’t even sign up for the race.”
Validate Efforts and Endurance
“I want to acknowledge how strong you are for getting through each day with this. You might not feel strong – you might feel worn out – but the fact that you’re here, pushing on, shows a lot of courage and resilience.”
“It’s okay to admit it’s hard. It doesn’t mean you’re not coping; it means you’re human and it hurts. You’re allowed to vent and not be ‘positive’ all the time about it.”
Discuss Coping Strategies
“What helps on the days when the pain or symptoms are a bit more manageable? Is there anything – maybe a heating pad, a short walk, a certain stretch, a distraction like a good TV show – that gives you even a small relief or comfort?”
“Let’s list out all the tools in your toolkit, even the ones that help 5%. Because on bad days, you can combine a few 5% things and maybe get 20% relief emotionally, if not physically.”
“Have you learned any pacing techniques? Like balancing activity and rest so you don’t overdo it on good days (which can lead to crash days). It’s hard when you want to live fully, but sometimes slowing down and listening to your body can help you have more consistent days. We can brainstorm what pacing might look like for you.”
Address the Emotional Toll
“Chronic pain often comes with grief – grief for the activities you can’t do like before, or the life you had envisioned without this pain. It’s important to acknowledge that. It’s okay to mourn the losses, whether it’s as simple as not being able to go jogging or as big as feeling like you’ve lost some independence.”
“And it’s normal to feel angry too. ‘Why me?’ is a common, fair question. It might not have an answer, but expressing that frustration is healthier than holding it in.”
Encourage Communication with Providers
“How is your communication with your doctors? Do you feel like they listen and are managing your pain well? If not, maybe we should strategize about advocating for yourself. You deserve adequate pain management and care. If one doctor isn’t helping, sometimes a second opinion or a specialist (like a pain specialist or rheumatologist, etc., depending on condition) can offer new options.”
“Also, have you connected with any support groups? Talking to others who get it can be really validating. Sometimes they share tips or at least you feel less alone in it. There are in-person ones and lots of online communities for just about every condition.”
Mind-Body Techniques
“Have you tried any mind-body approaches? Like meditation, gentle yoga, or breathing exercises? They’re not magic cures, but they can help dial down the perception of pain a notch or help you cope with it better. We could even try a short guided relaxation now, if you’d like, just to see if it gives you a tiny bit of relief or calm.”
Adaptive Focus
“Let’s identify what you can do, even with the pain, and find meaning or pleasure in those things. Maybe you can’t hike like you used to, but you can enjoy a nice picnic in the park or a drive with a scenic view. Or if you can’t work the hours you did before, maybe you can explore a hobby or skill that’s less physically taxing. It’s about adjusting goals – not giving up on living, but living differently.”
“Your worth isn’t determined by your productivity or physical ability. You still contribute to the world by just being you – with your thoughts, your conversations, your creations, whatever it may be. Chronic illness/pain might change how you do things, but it doesn’t change your value.”
Hope and Acknowledgment
“It might not feel like it sometimes, but improvements are possible. New treatments come out, flares can subside, or you might discover therapies that make a big difference. Holding onto a bit of hope for change is okay. And even if the condition remains, people do learn to live fulfilling lives around their pain – finding new routines, new passions, deeper empathy. It often changes you, but not always in only negative ways. Some people say it made them stronger or more compassionate or closer to certain people. We can try to find a silver lining while never minimizing the struggle.”
“I believe you about your pain – I want to stress that. Sometimes people feel like others don’t take them seriously. I take you seriously. I’m here to help you carry this, even if just by listening and problem-solving where we can.”
Affirmation
“You are doing the best you can in a really challenging situation. It’s okay to have days where you just rest and nothing else – that’s not laziness, that’s medicine for your body. It’s okay to feel upset and cry or vent – that’s medicine for your soul.”
“You’re not a burden for having this condition. And your life isn’t over because of it; it’s different, yes, but it can still have joy, meaning, and value. We’ll keep working on finding those pockets of light and making the most of the good days and easing the bad ones. You’re not alone in this – I’m with you, and so is your treatment team. We care about you, not just as a patient with pain, but as a whole person.”

💚 Struggling to Identify or Express Needs
(Client has trouble knowing what they need or asking for it – often saying “I don’t know what I want” or feeling their needs don’t matter.)
Highlight the Pattern
“It sounds like you often find yourself feeling unsatisfied or hurt because your needs aren’t met – but at the same time, you have a hard time even knowing or saying what those needs are. Does that ring true? That’s more common than you might think, especially for people who are used to putting others first or never learned to tune into their own desires.”
“First, I want to reassure you: your needs matter. They’re not silly or selfish. You deserve to have needs and to express them. I know you might feel fear or guilt around that, and we can work through it.”
Explore Early Messages
“Sometimes this difficulty comes from how we were raised or past relationships. Maybe as a kid you got the message that your needs were inconvenient, or you had to take care of others’ needs and ignore your own. Does any of that resonate? Understanding where it comes from can help us challenge it.”
“If you learned ‘be easy, don’t ask for anything’ to keep peace or affection, that might have been necessary back then. But now, as an adult, that rule is hurting more than helping. We can slowly unlearn it.”
Identify Needs in the Moment
“Let’s practice right now in a small way: How are you feeling in this moment with me? Do you need anything? For example, do you need a break? Some water? A slower pace? More direct questions? This is a low-stakes environment to practice identifying a need and voicing it. Whatever it is, I promise to take it seriously.”
If client says “I don’t know” or “I’m fine”: “
That’s okay– this is something we’ll keep practicing. Maybe after our session, check in with yourself: Did anything feel uncomfortable or missing? That could be a clue for next time.”
Help Clarify Needs vs. Emotions
“Sometimes it helps to differentiate between what you feel and what you might need. For example, if you feel lonely, the need might be connection. If you feel stressed, the need might be rest or help. If you feel resentful, maybe the need is for recognition or fairness.”
“Let’s take a feeling you had recently – say, you felt really frustrated last week when you stayed late at work. If we dig, maybe the need was ‘I need help or fair workload’ or ‘I need appreciation.’ Does that sound plausible? The idea is to train that muscle: emotion -> underlying need.”
Role-Play Asking
“Once you know a need, the next hurdle is expressing it. That can be scary if you fear rejection or conflict. We could do a little role-play. Like, if you need your partner to give you a bit more help at home, how might you say that? Perhaps: ‘Hey, I realized I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. It would really help me if you could cook dinner a couple nights a week. Could we try that?’”
“We can script it out and even practice aloud, if you want, so when the moment comes, you feel more confident. Start with low-stakes needs too, like telling a friend, ‘I’d actually prefer to go to X restaurant tonight.’ Each time they respond well, you’ll build confidence. And if someone responds poorly, that’s on them – reasonable people respect others’ needs.”
Encourage Self-Reflection Time
“You might need to spend some time getting to know yourself again. Maybe journaling could help: write down situations where you felt bad and ask yourself, ‘What did I need in that moment?’ At first you might write ‘I don’t know’ but if you keep at it, things will surface. It could be things like ‘I needed comfort’ or ‘I needed to feel heard.’ Even if you didn’t get it then, identifying it after the fact is progress.”
“Also pay attention to moments of resentment or burnout – they are often red flags that needs are unmet. For example, if you resent doing all the housework, the need might be help or acknowledgment. If you’re burnt out, the need might be rest or boundaries.”
Reinforce Boundaries
“Remember that it’s okay to say no or to ask for adjustments. It doesn’t make you a bad person. You have the right to take up space and have preferences. In fact, clearly expressing needs and boundaries often leads to healthier relationships – people aren’t left guessing or dealing with hidden resentment.”
“The people who truly care about you will want to meet your needs if they can; they might just not know them unless you voice them. And if someone regularly dismisses or tramples on your stated needs, that’s important information about that relationship.”
Affirmation
“You deserve to have your needs met, just like anyone else. It might feel foreign or even selfish at first, but it’s actually an act of self-respect – and it teaches others how to respect you too. I can already see you making progress: you identified at least one need today and we talked about ways to express it. That’s huge.”
“It’s going to take practice and maybe baby steps, but each time you honor one of your needs, you’re telling yourself ‘I matter.’ And you do matter – a lot, to a lot of people, and certainly to me as your coach. I’m proud of you for working on this, and I’m here to support you as you practice voicing what you need.”

💚 Enmeshed or Dependent Relationships
(Client struggles with maintaining personal boundaries or independence – e.g., overly dependent on a partner or parent, or in entangled relationships where they lose their sense of self.)
Validate the Difficulty
“It sounds like you feel really tangled up in this relationship – like your feelings and decisions are almost merged with theirs. That can be comforting at times, but also suffocating or confusing. It’s actually not uncommon to struggle with this, especially if the relationship is very close or long-standing. You’re definitely not alone in figuring out where you end and the other person begins.”
“It makes sense – if this is a parent or a long-time partner or friend, you two have a deep bond. But even with love, a little breathing room is healthy. You can love someone and still be your own person.”
Identify Personal Values and Interests
“Let’s talk about you – just you. What are some things you enjoy or value that are independent of this other person? It could be hobbies, goals, even opinions on things like favorite movies or foods. Anything that’s ‘yours.’”
“If it’s hard to think of any because you’ve been so connected, that’s okay. That’s something we can work on – exploring your identity. Maybe think back to before this relationship intensified – were there things you loved to do or dreams you had? We can start rekindling some of those.”
Small Steps Toward Independence
“We don’t have to do a drastic cutoff or anything; sometimes that idea can be scary. But we can try small steps. For example, could you spend one afternoon a week doing something on your own, without involving them – even as simple as going for a walk by yourself, or hanging out with another friend, or working on a personal project?”
“Or if you tend to immediately ask this person for advice on every decision, maybe challenge yourself to make one small decision alone each day – like what to have for dinner or which show to watch – without checking with them first, and see how that feels.”
Boundary Setting Conversation (if needed)
“It might help to talk with this person about what you’re feeling – in a gentle way. Something like, ‘I love you and our connection, and I’m also realizing I’ve lost a bit of myself. I think it would be good for me – and ultimately for us – if I try to do a few things on my own or make some decisions independently, just to build my confidence.’ Emphasize it’s not a rejection of them, but a growth step for you.”
“If they truly care, they’ll probably understand and support you. Sometimes people in enmeshed dynamics are also relieved to get a bit of breathing room themselves once it’s addressed.”
Coping with Guilt or Anxiety
“I suspect when you do things independently, you might feel pangs of guilt or anxiety, like you’re betraying them or they’ll be upset. Remind yourself that taking care of your own identity isn’t a betrayal; it’s healthy. And the relationship will actually benefit if each person is whole and not solely defined by the other.”
“Try a mantra: ‘Taking time for myself is not selfish; it’s necessary.’ Or ‘Healthy love includes two healthy individuals.’ You might also reassure the other person if needed: like if it’s a parent, ‘Mom, I’m going to decide this on my own – it doesn’t mean I don’t love you or value your input; I just need to learn to trust myself too.’”
Emergency Independence Plan
“Think about a scenario where the other person isn’t immediately available – maybe they go on a trip or are busy with work. What would you do then? It can sometimes help to pre-plan how you’d cope or who else you might lean on so you realize you can manage. Diversify your support system – maybe other friends, other family, therapists, coaches (like me), etc. That takes some pressure off the one relationship.”
“Also, envision the kind of person you want to be, separate from them. Not separate as in not together, but as in your own person. What qualities do you want to have? Maybe confidence, self-reliance, personal hobbies. We can set a goal like, ‘I want to be someone who can go to a movie alone and enjoy it,’ or ‘I want to be able to disagree with my partner calmly without fearing the relationship will end.’ Those can guide our steps.”
Affirmation of Self
“You might need to remind yourself regularly: ‘I am more than [the other person]’s [child/partner/friend]. I have my own identity.’ It doesn’t mean you care any less about them. In fact, relationships often get richer when each person brings their unique self to the table instead of just mirroring each other.”
“You have so many wonderful qualities and thoughts that are uniquely yours. It’d be a shame if they never got to shine because they were overshadowed by this relationship dynamic. I think as you step out a little, you’ll find parts of yourself that you really like and have missed.”
Encouragement
“This isn’t about ending or hurting the- relationship; it’s about strengthening it by strengthening you. It might feel a bit uncomfortable at first, like stretching new muscles, but each small step you take, the easier it will get. And I’ll want to hear about each victory, no matter how small – like ‘I went shopping and bought a shirt I liked without second-guessing if they’d approve,’ or ‘I told my friend I needed to leave the gathering early and didn’t feel guilty.’ Those are great wins.”
“You deserve to have your own life while sharing it with others. You can do this, step by step. And I’ll be here to support you, cheer you on, and help you process any bumps along the way.”

💚 Feeling Directionless or “Stuck” in Life
(Client feels aimless, without direction or motivation, unsure of their path or goals.)
Normalize and Empathize
“A lot of people go through periods of life where they feel lost or directionless. It can be really unsettling, like you’re drifting without a map. I hear that it’s bothering you and maybe even making you feel down on yourself. First off, it’s okay to not have everything figured out. Life isn’t a straight line for most of us.”
“Sometimes we put so much pressure on ourselves to have a grand plan or passion. The truth is, passions and directions often evolve over time and sometimes by trying different things and seeing what clicks.”
Identify Feelings vs. What You Want
“You mentioned feeling stuck. Can we clarify – do you feel stuck in a routine, in a job, in a lifestyle? Or more like an internal stuckness, like lack of motivation or clarity? Let’s pinpoint what specifically feels ‘stuck’.”
If routine/job: “Okay, so maybe your day-to-day feels monotonous or unfulfilling. That’s a clue that perhaps a change or new challenge could help – whether it’s in work, hobbies, or learning something new.”
If internal: “Feeling internally stuck (like no motivation, no vision) might mean it’s time to experiment a bit – expose yourself to new experiences, even small ones, to see if something sparks interest. When we feel nothing is meaningful, sometimes we just haven’t stumbled on the next thing that resonates.”
Explore Interests and Values
“Let’s do a quick brainstorm. No pressure, no matter is too small. What are some things that you’ve enjoyed in the past or that you are curious about trying? They can be anything: cooking, traveling, a subject like psychology, helping others, working with your hands, gaming, fitness, art, whatever.”
If they struggle: “Think about what you liked as a kid or times when you felt excited or proud. Or even envy – if you see someone else doing something and feel a pang of envy, sometimes that’s because part of you wants that.”
“Now, among those things or new ones, which align with your values? If one of your values is, say, creativity, maybe you need more creative outlets. If it’s helping others, maybe volunteering or a helping career. If it’s freedom, maybe you need to travel or have flexibility. Sometimes direction becomes clearer when we focus on what we truly value in life.”
Set Small Experiments
“You don’t have to commit to a huge life change immediately. How about we set up some small experiments? For example, if you’re curious about tech, take an online coding workshop. If you think helping others could be fulfilling, volunteer one Saturday at a shelter. If you liked art, buy some paints and play around. These low-stakes trials can give you feedback on what energizes you or not.”
“Think of it like trying on clothes; you have to try a few things to see what fits. And it’s totally fine if some things don’t – that’s useful information too. Eliminating what you don’t like is part of finding what you do.”
Discuss Goals (Long and Short Term)
“Maybe the word ‘direction’ feels overwhelming. Let’s break it down. How about setting a short-term goal that excites you even a little? Could be ‘complete a 30-day fitness challenge’ or ‘read one new book this month’ or ‘save up for a weekend trip somewhere.’ Achieving a small goal can build confidence and momentum.”
“Long-term goals can be more flexible – like ‘in five years I’d like to be in a career that helps people,’ or ‘someday I want to live in a house by the ocean.’ It’s okay if these are fuzzy. We can outline a direction without a strict timeline – like heading north without knowing the exact address yet.”
Address Fear of Wrong Choices
“Sometimes people feel stuck because they’re afraid of picking the wrong path. It’s worth remembering: few decisions are truly irreversible. If you try a path and it’s not right, you can pivot. Life is more like a zigzag than a straight line for many of us. Every experience, even if it doesn’t become the thing, teaches you something and often leads to the next opportunity.”
“Think of it like a GPS: you might take a turn and later find a better route, and you reroute. It’s all part of the journey. So maybe release yourself from the pressure of finding the perfect direction – let’s aim for a good direction for now, one that feels better than standing still.”
Motivation and Routine
“Feeling aimless can also sap your energy. One trick is to create a bit of routine to give structure while you’re figuring things out. For example, set a small morning routine (like: get up by X time, make your bed, go for a 10-minute walk). Having that can provide a sense of purpose to start the day, even if the big picture is still hazy.”
“Additionally, celebrating small wins – like, ‘I applied to one job’ or ‘I tried a new class’ – can boost motivation. It’s like giving yourself little gold stars that propel you forward.”
Support System
“Remember you don’t have to find your direction all by yourself. Talk to friends or mentors about how they found theirs – you might get ideas or just reassurance that it’s okay to wander a bit. If possible, maybe even work with a career counselor or life coach (besides me) for specific guidance if it’s about career direction. Using resources is a smart move, not a weakness.”
“Sometimes getting out of your usual environment helps too. Travel if you can, or even explore a new part of town. New stimuli can spark new thoughts.”
Positive Outlook
“I have a feeling that by virtue of you caring about this and working on it, you’re going to discover something that clicks. It might not be an epiphany like lightning bolt – more like gradually, you’ll notice, ‘Hey, I enjoyed that’ and do more of it, and over time a path emerges.”
“Life chapters change. You might be between chapters, which is uncomfortable, but also full of possibility. The unknown is scary but also where anything can happen.”
Encouragement
“I truly believe you’re capable of finding a fulfilling direction. I’ve seen you be thoughtful and resourceful in our talks. Those qualities will serve you well. And remember, a direction doesn’t have to be grand to be worthwhile – being a kind person, being a good parent or friend, continuously learning – those are great life directions too.”
“Let’s commit to one step this week: identify one small experiment or goal and do it. Then we’ll debrief on how it felt. Bit by bit, we’ll light up the path ahead. It might twist and turn, but you’ll be moving, and movement is progress.”

💚 Time Management and Organization
(Client struggles with managing time, procrastination, or staying organized, and wants to build better habits.)
Positive Frame
“You’re looking to get more organized and manage your time better – that’s a great goal. These skills can make life so much less stressful once they click, and I’m excited to help you with it. First off, don’t beat yourself up for struggling here; a lot of people were never formally taught how to do this. It’s learnable at any age.”
“And it’s good that you recognize it – that’s the first step. It means you have the insight and desire to change, which is half the battle.”
Assess Current Situation
“Let’s talk about where it breaks down. Do you find you have trouble starting tasks (procrastination)? Or finishing tasks? Or forgetting tasks? Or feeling overwhelmed by tasks? Maybe all of the above?”
Okay, you mention procrastinating on assignments until the last minute and forgetting appointments. Those are two key issues: procrastination and tracking tasks.
Procrastination Tips
“Procrastination is often not about laziness – sometimes it’s about fear (like fear of failure so you avoid starting), or feeling overwhelmed and not knowing where to start, or just our brains seeking instant gratification (YouTube is more fun than writing a report, right?).”
“One trick that helps is the ‘5-minute rule.’ Tell yourself you’re just going to work on the dreaded task for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, if you want to stop, you can. Often, just starting is the biggest hurdle – once you start, momentum carries you forward and you might end up doing more. But giving yourself permission to stop reduces the intimidation to start.”
“Another approach is breaking the task into teeny tiny chunks. Instead of ‘Write essay,’ chunk it to: ‘1) Open a Word doc, 2) write a rough title, 3) jot three bullet points of ideas.’ Then do one chunk at a time. You get a sense of progress and it feels less daunting.”
“Also, try to figure out when in the day you have the most energy or focus. If you’re a morning person, tackle important tasks then. If you rev up in the evening, use that. Align tasks with your natural rhythm.”
Organization Tools
“For forgetting and tracking tasks, external systems are your friend. Relying on memory alone is tough with a busy life or a brain that doesn’t naturally organize. Do you use a calendar or planner currently? If not, that’s step one: start using one.”
“It could be a paper planner if you like tangible things, or a digital calendar on your phone with reminders (like Google Calendar). The key is to put everything in it: appointments, deadlines, even routines (‘7am take medication’, ‘Thursday 6pm – gym’). And set alerts for important things, like a day before a deadline or an hour before a meeting.”
“For to-do lists, some people like a simple notebook list each day, others like apps like Todoist or Trello that are more dynamic. We can try one out. Let’s say each evening, you write down 3-5 tasks for the next day, in order of priority. That way you wake up knowing what’s on deck.”
“Also, batching similar tasks together can save time – like answer all emails in a 30-minute block rather than checking constantly. Or run all your errands in one trip.”
Time Management Techniques
“Have you heard of the Pomodoro Technique? It’s where you work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break, then repeat. After 4 cycles, you take a longer break. It’s great for those of us who have trouble focusing for long periods – you know a break is coming, so you push during the work interval. We can adjust times if needed (some prefer 50/10).”
“Another thing: try to estimate how long tasks actually take versus how long you think they take. People often under- or overestimate. Keep a log for a few days: e.g., ‘Writing report – thought 2 hours, actually took 4.’ This helps you plan more realistically in the future.”
Boundary Setting for Time
“Sometimes time management is about learning to say no or not over-committing. If your plate is too full, no amount of scheduling will fix that. Is that an issue for you – do you take on too much or have trouble declining requests?”
If yes: “Maybe practice a polite way to buy time like, ‘Let me check my schedule and get back to you.’ That gives you space to decide if you actually have time. It’s okay to protect your time. You can’t do everything for everyone.”
Encourage Habits and Routine
“Our brains thrive on routine. If you can make certain things routine, you don’t have to expend as much mental energy remembering or motivating yourself. For example, always do a quick tidy of your workspace after lunch, or always review your calendar every morning with your coffee. Over time it becomes automatic.”
“Also consider habit stacking: attach a new habit to an existing one. If you always brush your teeth in the morning (existing habit), right after that (new habit) check your planner for the day. The established habit acts as a trigger for the new one.”
Acknowledge Progress
“When you do follow your plan or complete things on time, reward yourself in some small way. Maybe a little treat or just an internal high-five and acknowledge it: ‘Hey, I did what I set out to do today, nice.’ Positive reinforcement will make you more likely to do it again.”
“And if you slip up or a day goes off the rails, don’t despair. It happens. Instead of beating yourself up, analyze it: What made me derail? How can I adjust? Then restart. The only true failure is giving up entirely; everything else is just learning.”
Support
“We can keep tweaking these strategies to fit you. Maybe we’ll find you love digital tools, or maybe you stick with a sticky note system – whatever works. The goal isn’t to be perfect, but to feel more in control of your time and tasks.”
“Remember, the goal of time management and organization is to reduce stress and free you up to enjoy life more, not to box you in. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll likely feel a lot lighter and more competent. And I already see that potential in you – you’re taking initiative by addressing this. That’s a great sign.”
Plan
“So let’s plan a couple of concrete steps: For this week, how about you try using a planner or calendar daily, and practice the 5-minute start rule on one thing you’ve been putting off? Then next time we talk, we’ll see how it went and adjust if needed.”
“I’m excited for you – these skills will serve you your whole life. And I’ll be here to support you as you implement them. You’ve got this!”

💚 Decision-Making
(Client has difficulty making decisions, big or small, and wants to improve their confidence in choosing.)
Frame the Issue
“Decision-making can be really stressful, especially if you’re afraid of making the wrong choice or if you’ve got a lot of options. It’s actually great that you want to work on this; being more confident in your decisions can reduce a lot of anxiety.”
“First, know that very few decisions are totally irreversible. We often feel like one decision will lock in our fate forever, but most of the time, if new information comes up or if we realize it’s not right, we can course-correct. Realizing that can take some pressure off.”
Establish Criteria
“For bigger decisions, it helps to clarify what factors are most important to you. We can make a simple pros and cons list, but beyond that, maybe weight the pros and cons by importance.”
“For example, choosing a job: Important factors might be salary, location, growth opportunities, interest in the work. If one job pays more but another is in a city you love, how do those weigh out for you personally? We can even score them 1-10 on each factor if you like being analytical.”
“Sometimes writing it out or using a spreadsheet (if you’re into that) can help make a nebulous decision more concrete.”
Listen to Gut and Head
“It’s good to analyze, but also consider your gut feeling. Our instincts are basically our subconscious pulling from past experiences and values. If something ‘feels’ off, that’s data too. Conversely, if you secretly hope one of the options is the one you’ll end up with, notice that. It might be your heart telling you what it wants, even if it doesn’t seem logical at first.”
“It can help to imagine you already made the decision for each option and live with it mentally for a day. Like, say ‘I have decided to move to X city’ and see how you feel that day. Then next day, ‘I have decided to stay put.’ Sometimes your emotional reaction to the imagined decision reveals your preference.”
Set a Deadline and Limits
“Indecision can drag on forever if we let it. For many choices, it helps to set yourself a decision deadline. Like, ‘I will choose by Friday.’ And maybe gather information until Wednesday, then spend Thursday reflecting, and decide Friday. If you need someone to hold you to it, I can check in, or you can tell a friend to ask you.”
“Also, if you have 10 options, try to narrow to 2 or 3 finalists quickly. Often the more options, the more overwhelmed. If you can eliminate some (even if it’s, ‘not this one because my gut says no’), that’s progress.”
Accept “Good Enough” and Uncertainty
“One concept is the difference between a maximizer and a satisficer. Maximizers want the absolute best decision every time; satisficers look for an option that meets their needs and once they find it, they’re good, even if it might not be ‘the best ever.’ Striving to be a bit more of a satisficer can ease decision paralysis. Sometimes a decision that’s 80% great is great enough. You don’t have to analyze to 100% certainty because that’s often impossible.”
“In other words, aim for a good decision, not a perfect one. Perfection in decisions is usually only known in hindsight and even then, who knows.”
Learn from Past Decisions
“Think about some decisions you made that turned out well. What process did you use? Or even decisions that turned out not great – what did you learn? Use that wisdom now. For instance, ‘Last time I ignored my gut and I regretted it’ or ‘I rushed without research and missed something important.’ Let’s incorporate those lessons.”
“Also, give yourself credit: I’ll bet you’ve made more good decisions in life than you realize. You decided to seek help and self-improve – that’s a great decision right there.”
Tiny Decisions Practice
“If big decisions are too scary to start with, practice on small ones. For example, deliberately decide to try a new food off a menu without second-guessing, or pick the movie for movie night, or choose a new route home. Notice that the world doesn’t end and maybe you enjoy some of your choices. This builds confidence over time for bigger stuff.”
“One strategy: limit the time you spend on trivial decisions. Like give yourself 30 seconds to pick a restaurant for lunch. Training that ‘just decide and move on’ muscle on low-stakes things helps strengthen it.”
Deal with Regret Fear
“A lot of decision angst is fear of regret. Remind yourself: you made the best decision you could with the information you had at the time. If later information shows it wasn’t ideal, that’s not because you were foolish; you just didn’t have a crystal ball. And you can adapt then.”
“It might sound funny, but sometimes I tell people: decide, and then make the decision right. Meaning, once you choose, commit to it and put in effort to make it succeed rather than continually questioning it. For instance, choose a job and then work hard and have a positive attitude so that job becomes a great experience. The energy you put in after deciding often matters more than the choice itself.”
Support System Input
“It can help to talk it out with someone neutral (like we are doing) or someone who’s been in your shoes. Just be careful not to get 50 different opinions – that can make it worse. Maybe pick one or two trusted sounding boards.”
“Ultimately, though, remember it’s your life. Well-meaning people might push you one way, but you’re the one who lives with it. Trust that you know yourself better than anyone else does.”
Encouragement
“I have confidence that you’re going to become more decisive. You’re thoughtful, which is a good thing – it means you won’t make reckless choices. Our goal is just to get you to a place where you can choose in a reasonable timeframe and feel at peace with it.”
“However it turns out, you’ll handle it. You’ve handled everything in life so far – maybe not perfectly, but you’re here, learning, growing. This decision (or set of decisions) is just another thing you’ll handle and learn from.”
“I’ll be here to bounce things off as you need. And hey, deciding to tackle your decision-making issues – that’s a decision you’ve already made. Check – one good decision done! We’ll build from there.”

💚 Perfectionism
(Client has extremely high standards for themselves, leading to stress, procrastination, or self-criticism, and wants to work on being more balanced.)
Acknowledge the Upside and Downside
“It sounds like you have some perfectionistic tendencies – like you set very high standards for yourself and maybe feel like nothing you do is ever quite good enough. On one hand, that drive can push you to achieve great things. On the other hand, it’s really exhausting and can make you avoid things for fear of not doing them perfectly. Does that capture it?”
“I want to say: striving for excellence isn’t a bad trait. But when it’s perfection or nothing, it can paralyze you or make you really unhappy. There’s a saying: ‘Perfect is the enemy of good.’ Sometimes chasing perfect means we don’t get to appreciate the good or even the great in what we do.”
Explore Root Beliefs
“Often perfectionism comes from a belief like ‘If I’m not perfect, I’m not enough’ or ‘Mistakes are unacceptable.’ Do any thoughts like that ring a bell for you? Maybe something you grew up with? Figuring out the core fear can help – like fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of losing control.”
“If, for example, it’s fear of criticism: The truth is, people actually often respond fine to human imperfection. In fact, sometimes they connect more with you when you’re not perfect, because it’s relatable. If it’s fear of self-worth: remember your worth isn’t tied to achievements. You as a person are valuable inherently.”
Set "Good-Enough" Goals
“Let’s practice recalibrating expectations. For a given task, ask yourself: what would ‘good enough’ look like? Not terrible, not flawless, just satisfactory. And aim for that initially. You can always improve later, but give yourself permission to stop at good enough.”
“For instance, if you’re writing an essay, maybe good enough is writing all the points clearly even if the phrasing isn’t poetry. You can then polish a little, but don’t spend 3 hours on whether one sentence has the perfect wording.”
Challenge All-or-Nothing Thinking
“Perfectionism often comes with all-or-nothing thinking: ‘I got one B, so I’m a failure’ or ‘If this presentation isn’t the best, it’s a disaster.’ Let’s actively challenge that. Is a B really a failure, or is it actually above average? If one person in the audience didn’t like the presentation, does that truly negate the value for the others who did?”
“One strategy: purposely allow yourself to do something poorly, as an exercise. For example, draw a silly, bad sketch if you’re a perfectionist artist. Or intentionally make a minor typo in a draft and see that the world doesn’t crumble. It’s uncomfortable, but it can be freeing and prove a point that imperfection is survivable.”
Address Procrastination from Perfectionism
“You mentioned sometimes you procrastinate because you want the conditions to be perfect or you feel you can’t meet the standard. Try the motto, ‘Done is better than perfect.’ Starting something, even if you know it’s rough, gives you material to refine. But you can’t refine a blank page. So, commit to a ‘bad first draft’ – of anything – with the knowledge you can edit later.”
“Also, impose some time limits for yourself. If you have a task, say you’ll spend X hours on it and then submit it or consider it done, rather than endlessly tweaking. Many times, those extra tweaks don’t dramatically improve the outcome, they just eat time and cause stress.”
Self-Compassion Practice
“You likely speak to yourself very harshly when you’re not perfect. Try to cultivate a more compassionate inner voice. A good trick is to talk to yourself as if you were your best friend or someone you deeply care about. You wouldn’t call them a failure for a minor mistake, right? You’d likely say, ‘Hey, it’s okay, nobody’s perfect, you did your best.’ You deserve the same kindness.”
“Maybe make a list of what you’ve accomplished or done well (even if not perfectly) and periodically remind yourself of that. And celebrate progress, not just perfection. If you improved in something or handled something better than before, that’s a win.”
Benefits of Imperfection
“Sometimes leaving things a little imperfect opens the door for others to contribute or for creativity to happen. For example, if you’re a leader and you delegate a task, it might not be done exactly how you would, but it frees you up for other things and might bring in fresh ideas. If you share a work in progress with colleagues, they might add ideas that make it better than what you alone would craft striving for perfection in isolation.”
“And consider this: some of the most beloved art and creations have imperfections. A handmade mug with a little asymmetry has charm. Your humanity – little flaws and all – is endearing to others. It makes you approachable.”
Perfectionism and Burnout
“If you go at 110% on everything, you risk burning out. Then nothing gets done. It’s more sustainable to go at, say, 90% on most things and save that 110% effort for truly important areas. Sort of picking your battles. Ask yourself: Is this thing worth the extra time to perfect, or would that energy be better used elsewhere? Often, the answer is that it’s not worth it.”
“Set priorities. For example, maybe at work, the report’s content accuracy is top priority (needs near-perfection), but the formatting being perfectly pretty is lower priority (good enough is fine). Focus accordingly.”
Encouragement
“Change won’t happen overnight, but you can absolutely shift to a healthier mindset. I’ve seen many former perfectionists learn to lighten up and actually end up performing better because they’re not tying themselves in knots. You’ve already taken a huge step by acknowledging it and wanting to change – that’s something a perfectionist might normally struggle to admit (since it’s admitting a flaw, ironically). But you did, and that’s brave and awesome.”
“I’ll be here to remind you along the way: it’s okay to be human. I certainly don’t expect perfection from you – I actually prefer you just be you. That’s enough. You are enough, as you are. Let’s keep working on letting yourself internalize that.”

💚 Life Transitions
(Client is going through or preparing for a significant life change – graduation, career change, retirement, becoming a parent, etc. – and feeling uncertain or anxious about it.)
Normalize Transition Anxiety
“Big changes – even positive ones – can be really unsettling. It’s totally normal to feel anxious or unsure when you’re entering a new phase of life. You’re basically stepping into the unknown in some ways, and our brains tend to go ‘Whoa, is this safe?’”
“It sounds like you’re dealing with [name the transition: starting a new job, moving city, leaving school, etc.]. A lot of people in your shoes feel exactly what you’re feeling: a mix of excitement, fear, sadness for what’s ending, and hope for what’s beginning. You’re not alone in that.”
Honor the Past Chapter
“One thing that can help is to properly say goodbye to the chapter you’re closing. For example, if you’re graduating, take some time to reflect on what the experience meant, maybe even have a small celebration or write a journal entry to capture the memories. If you’re leaving a job or city, make a keepsake or have a farewell with friends. Marking the end can make it easier to begin anew.”
“It’s okay to feel a little grief or nostalgia. That doesn’t mean you’re not ready or that the new chapter is wrong – it just means that last chapter mattered to you. And that’s a good thing.”
Embrace Curiosity for the Future
“Try shifting some of the anxiety into curiosity. Instead of ‘What if I can’t handle it?’ think ‘I wonder what this new experience will teach me?’ or ‘I wonder who I’ll meet or what opportunities will come?’ It’s like turning the apprehension into a sense of adventure. Because truly, you don’t know what’s out there – and that means it could be wonderful things, not just challenges.”
“It can also help to set some small goals in the new chapter to give you a sense of direction. Like if moving to a new city, goal might be ‘find one coffee shop I love’ or ‘join one social group’. If new job, perhaps ‘meet with each team member 1:1 in first month’ or ‘learn X skill in first 3 months.’ Achievable targets can anchor you when everything else is new.”
Use Old Skills in New Ways
“Remember that even though the context is changing, you’re bringing all your accumulated skills and wisdom with you. Think about other transitions you’ve navigated in the past – starting high school, starting prior jobs, etc. What helped you then? You likely have some strategies that worked (maybe you introduced yourself to people, or learned the layout, or found a routine). You can apply those again.”
“Also list your strengths. Are you good at adapting, listening, asking questions, working hard, making friends? Those strengths will serve you in this new phase. Trust that you have them.”
Build a Support System
“In times of change, leaning on support is key. Stay connected with your old friends/colleagues even as you make new ones. Talk to people who’ve been through similar transitions – they often have great advice or at least can reassure you that your feelings are normal and it turned out okay for them.”
“If you’re comfortable, let your family or close friends know you’re feeling a bit unsettled. Sometimes just having people check in on you during the first few weeks of a change can really help.”
Stay Present and Patient
“Try to take it one day at a time, and be patient with yourself. You don’t have to have everything figured out in the new situation immediately. It’s okay if it feels weird or hard at first. Give yourself at least a few weeks or months to truly adjust before you judge whether you ‘like’ it or are ‘good’ at it. Initial discomfort is not an indicator of failure; it’s just part of adjusting.”
“For example, I often say: the first day/week of anything new might feel chaotic or like ‘What have I done?’ – that’s normal. By week 4 or so, you start finding a groove. By month 6, you often look back and say, ‘Wow, I’ve grown into this.’”
Mindset of Growth
“Life transitions are where a lot of growth happens, because you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. It might help to frame it as an exciting growth opportunity. This is going to stretch you in good ways – you’ll learn new things about the world and yourself. Often we come out the other side of a transition more confident.”
“And remember: it’s also okay to feel scared or sad in the middle of it. Growth can be uncomfortable. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Think of a caterpillar turning into a butterfly – I imagine that transition is probably weird and uncomfortable, but look what comes of it.”
Plan Some Self-Care
“During the transition, make sure to take care of yourself. Keep some routines that ground you (like a daily walk or journaling or your favorite workout), because when one part of life is changing, having consistency in other parts helps stability. And treat yourself kindly – get enough rest, eat well, and do things that relax you. Transition stress is real, so counterbalance it actively.”
“If you find yourself overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out to talk (like you’re doing now) or even seek out local resources (maybe a support group if it’s like new parents group, or new students orientation events, etc.). They exist to help people through exactly this.”
Encouragement
“I have a lot of faith in you. Everything you’ve shared with me shows me you’re resourceful and conscientious. Those qualities will carry you through this change. And you don’t have to do it perfectly – you just have to do it your way, at your pace.”
“A year from now, you might look back and marvel at how far you’ve come, how much you’ve learned. It’s okay if right now you’re in the ‘unknown’ and it feels shaky. That’s the first step of any meaningful journey. I’m excited for you, honestly – new chapters, while intimidating, often bring some of the most memorable and rewarding experiences. You’ve got this, and I’m here for you whenever you need a steadying hand along the way.”

💚 Building Healthy Habits & Routines
(Client wants to establish better daily habits (exercise, reading, etc.) or break bad ones, and seeks guidance on sticking to routines.)
Praise the Initiative
“It’s fantastic that you want to build healthy habits. That’s a big step toward improving your day-to-day life. Habits and routines can really give you a sense of stability and make those positive actions almost automatic over time. It takes effort to set them up, but then they start working for you.”
“Remember, it’s not about overhauling everything overnight; it’s about small, consistent changes that add up.”
Start Small and Specific
“One common mistake is trying to change too much at once or setting huge goals like ‘I’ll exercise an hour every day’ when currently you’re not exercising at all. That often leads to burnout. It’s better to start with something so small it almost seems easy or silly. That way you’re more likely to stick with it.”
“For example, if you want to exercise, maybe start with 10 minutes of activity each morning – a short walk or a quick yoga routine. If you want to read more, try 5 pages a night rather than 50. Once the small habit sticks, you can gradually increase.”
“Also, define your habits clearly. Instead of ‘eat healthier’, say ‘have one fruit with breakfast instead of a pastry’ or ‘drink water instead of soda at lunch.’ Clarity helps execution.”
Habit Stacking
“We touched on this earlier – attaching a new habit to an existing one. It’s a proven strategy. For instance, if you want to meditate daily and you already brush your teeth every morning, you could meditate right after brushing. The established habit cues the new one.”
“Think of daily anchors you already have – waking up, meal times, commutes, bedtime – and consider inserting new habits around those anchors. Maybe do stretches right after you shut down your work computer each day, etc.”
Create Cues and Environment
“Make the healthy choice the easy choice. If you want to go running in the morning, lay out your running clothes and shoes by your bed the night before (cue and convenience). If you want to drink more water, keep a water bottle on your desk in sight. Conversely, if you want to cut a bad habit like late-night snacking, maybe don’t stock the very tempting snacks at home, or keep them on a hard-to-reach shelf.”
“Use alarms or reminders at first if needed. An alarm to prompt you to start winding down for bed, or a reminder on your phone to take a break and stretch at 3pm. Eventually the goal is you won’t need them, but they help in the early stages.”
Accountability and Tracking
“It can really help to track your habits – like a habit journal or an app where you tick off each day you did the behavior. Seeing a streak can be motivating (you won’t want to break the chain!). Also consider having an accountability partner – maybe you and a friend agree to check in on each other’s progress weekly. Or you report to me on how you did; I’m happy to be that accountability if it helps.”
“If you slip up, don’t beat yourself up – instead, use the two-day rule: never miss twice in a row. If you didn’t do your habit today, make sure to do it tomorrow. That way, a slip doesn’t become a fall.”
Reward Yourself
“When establishing a new habit, pairing it with a positive reward can reinforce it. The reward can be immediate (like, ‘if I go to the gym, I get to watch my favorite show afterwards’ or something small like a nice cup of your favorite tea after a study session). Or it can be cumulative (‘if I hit my goal of practicing guitar 5 days this week, I’ll treat myself to new guitar strings or a song download’). Make sure the reward doesn’t conflict with the habit (like using cake as a reward for exercising is a bit counterproductive if the goal is weight loss), but something that genuinely makes you happy.”
“Also recognize the intrinsic rewards – like how you feel. Often, new habits like exercise or reading have built-in benefits (endorphins, sense of calm) but we sometimes overlook them. After you do the habit, take a moment to notice: ‘I feel proud’ or ‘I feel refreshed.’ That acknowledgment itself can reinforce the habit because you’re mentally pairing it with feeling good.”
Adjust as Needed
“Be willing to tweak the routine as you learn what works for you. If mornings aren’t working for exercise, maybe lunchtime or evenings are better. If reading at night always puts you to sleep, maybe read over lunch. The key is to find what fits your natural rhythm and life constraints. What works for someone else might not work for you, and that’s okay.”
“And build in some flexibility. Life will happen – travel, illness, busy seasons. It’s okay to adapt your habits during those times instead of dropping them entirely. Like maybe on vacation your exercise habit becomes just taking walks instead of gym sessions. That’s still maintaining the spirit of the habit.”
Gradual Build and Habit Mastery
“Focus on one or two habits at a time rather than ten. It might feel slow, but it’s effective. Once those become second nature, you can tackle new ones. You’ll gain confidence with each success. It’s like leveling up in a game – start with easy levels (simple habits), then progress.”
“You can even make a Habit checklist and check them off daily – things like: made my bed, drank water, took vitamins, 15 min of study, etc. A visual can be satisfying.”
Encouragement
“I believe you’re going to do great at this. You’ve already shown determination by bringing it up and planning it through. Remember to be patient and kind to yourself. Habits take time to solidify – some say 21 days, some say more, but there’s no magic number. It varies per person and habit. The key is consistency over time, not perfection. If you miss a day, it’s not all ruined – just pick back up.”
“Celebrate the journey. Each day you succeed is a win. And even the days you don’t, you learn something. You’re basically training your brain like a muscle – it might be sore or resistant at first, but it gets stronger and more adaptable.”
“I’m here to support you and cheer you on. Can’t wait to hear about your progress as you go. You got this – one step, one day at a time!”

"When you feel completely overwhelmed, we can try a skill called TIPP to hijack your body's stress response. Let's start with Temperature. Splashing cold water on your face or holding an ice cube triggers the 'dive response,' which quickly lowers your heart rate." 

T - Temperature:
"First, let's try to change your body temperature. The idea is to create a sudden shift. If you can, go splash some cold water on your face - really let it cover your cheeks and the area under your eyes. Or, you can hold an ice cube in your hand, or press it to your temples or wrists for about 30 seconds. If you use water on your face, try holding your breath for those 30 seconds, like you're diving into cool water. This can help slow your heart rate down very quickly when you're agitated."
"If you're feeling very down or numb, sometimes warmth can be helpful - like a warm drink or wrapping in a blanket, but for intense agitation, cold is usually the first choice."
I - Intense Exercise:
"If you're feeling a lot of restless, built-up energy, a very short burst of exercise - maybe 60 seconds to a couple of minutes."
"Could you do some jumping jacks, run in place as fast as you can, do some fast push-ups against a wall, or even just tense and release all your big muscle groups very hard and fast?"
"The goal is to burn off that surge of physical energy that comes with strong emotions."
"Make sure not to overdo it, just enough to get your heart rate up a bit and then let it come down."
P - Paced Breathing:
"Now, let's focus on slowing your breath. We're going to make your exhale longer than your inhale. Try breathing in deeply through your nose.......and then breathe out very slowly and gently through your mouth. Imagine you are blowing through a straw as you exhale. Let's repeat this a few times."  
P - Paired Muscle Relaxation:
"We can try Paired Muscle Relaxation. This means relaxing your muscles as you exhale. As you continue breathing slowly, when you breathe in, tense a group of muscles."
"Let's try that with your HANDS and ARMS; inhale through your nose, make tight fists. Squeeze your hands really tight, feel the tension in your fingers, your palms, your forearms. Hold that tension. Now as you exhale, slowly release the squeeze. Let your hands and arms go limp. Notice the difference between the tension and relaxation."
Key Principles/Rationale (Why it Helps): By changing body chemistry through temperature, intense exercise, paced breathing, and paired muscle relaxation, TIPP skills create a window for the client to re-engage their thinking brain and reduce the feeling of being hijacked by emotion.
2. ACCEPTS: For Distress Tolerance (Distraction)
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
What: An acronym for skills used to tolerate and survive moments of high distress without making things worse, especially when you can't solve the problem right now. These are short-term distraction and self-soothing tools.
When: When a client is highly distressed but TIPP isn't quite right or they need a longer/different strategy; to help ride out intense (but non-life-threatening) urges; to manage intense grief or hopelessness in the moment.
"When you're feeling overwhelmed and can't fix things right now, sometimes the best thing is to find a way to get through the next few minutes or hours without acting impulsively. Let's think about some 'ACCEPTS' strategies you could use:"
A - Activities: "What healthy, absorbing activities could you do to take your mind off things? (e.g., Watch a movie, do a puzzle, go for a walk, listen to music)."
C - Contributing: "Can you contribute by doing something helpful or kind for someone else? (e.g., Help a family member, do a small favour, volunteer - even online)."
C - Comparisons: (Use with caution) "Can you compare yourself to a time you felt even worse (and got through it), or perhaps to others who might be struggling more? This can sometimes shift perspective, but only if it doesn't lead to guilt."
E - Emotions: "Can you generate different emotions? (e.g., Watch a comedy, read an inspiring story, listen to uplifting music)."
P - Pushing Away: "Can you temporarily push away the painful thoughts or situation? Imagine putting them in a box to deal with later (when you're calmer or with your therapist)." (See also Interventions: ACT Defusion: Distancing)
T - Thoughts: "Can you occupy your mind with other thoughts? (e.g., Count backwards from 100, do mental math, recite lyrics, plan a neutral event in detail)."
S - Sensations: "Can you use intense sensations (non-harmful) to shift focus? (e.g., Hold an ice cube, take a very cold/hot shower, listen to loud music, smell strong peppermint)."  
B. Core DBT Skills (Beyond TIPP & ACCEPTS)
1. Radical Acceptance
What: Accepting reality as it is, without judgment, approval, or bitterness. It is about letting go of the fight against what you cannot change. 
When: When a client is fighting unchangeable realities (e.g., loss, difficult circumstances), turning pain into suffering. 
"Radical acceptance is about acknowledging the facts of reality, even if we don't like them. It's not approval; it's letting go of the fight. Let's remind ourselves, 'This is what happened. I cannot change it.' What would it feel like to stop fighting this reality?" 

Core Rationale: Fighting reality doesn't change it; it only creates more suffering. Acceptance frees up the energy you were using to fight, allowing you to focus on coping effectively and moving forward. Reduces emotional amplification and suffering that comes from resisting what is. It does not mean liking or approving of the reality, nor giving up on future change.
"Pain is an unavoidable part of life, but suffering often arises from our non-acceptance of reality, from fighting against what is. Radical acceptance is about acknowledging reality as it is in this very moment... This doesn't mean liking the reality or giving up on future change, but it can significantly reduce the emotional amplification and suffering..."

"Right now, this moment is feeling incredibly painful. Let's briefly try to acknowledge that this is how it is, without fighting it?" "I invite you to say to yourself, silently or out loud: 'This is what's happening right now. I don't have to like it. I don't have to approve of it. But it is what is true in this very second.'"

2. Name the Urge, Challenge the Urge
(DBT)
What: A skill to create distance from an intense urge by first identifying it and then exploring alternative actions.
When: When clients experience strong urges to engage in unhelpful or harmful behaviors (e.g., self-harm, substance use, avoidance, lashing out).
"When you feel a really strong urge, like an intense desire to [client's specific urge, e.g., 'isolate,' 'avoid this feeling,' 'lash out'], the first step can be just to name it. Silently to yourself, or out loud with me if you're comfortable, can you say, 'There's the urge to [specific urge]'?"
"Okay, now that we've named it... let's get curious about it for a second, without judgment and without immediately acting on it."
"Ask yourself... If I don't follow this urge right now, what's the very next thing that might happen, or what's one small thing I could do instead...?"
3. Opposite Action in Micro
 (DBT)
What: Doing something different, even in a very small way, than what an unhelpful emotion is urging you to do, especially when the emotion doesn't fit the facts or isn't helpful.
When: When emotions are leading to unhelpful action urges (e.g., withdrawing when sad, avoiding when anxious, attacking when angry).
Why: Stops feeding unhelpful emotions with actions that keep them stuck and gives a chance to experience something different.
"Sometimes our emotions push us to do things that actually keep the emotion going strong... Opposite action is about doing something different..."
"When you're feeling [specific emotion], what does that feeling make you want to do? What's the action urge...?"
"Okay, so the feeling of [emotion] makes you want to [action urge]. Now, let's think about what the opposite of that action would be, even in a very, very small way - a micro-opposite action."
"If you feel like shutting down completely and not moving, what's one tiny movement you could make? Could you wiggle your fingers or toes for five seconds?... You in for trying that small opposite movement?"

4. DEAR MAN: For Interpersonal Effectiveness
(DBT)
What: A structured way to ask for something you want or to say "no" effectively and assertively.
When: When a client needs to make a request, set a boundary, or address a conflict; helpful for those struggling to identify or express needs or wanting to build assertiveness skills.

"When you need to ask for something important or say no, it can be helpful to structure it. Let's walk through the DEAR MAN steps for [client's situation]:"
D - Describe: "Just the facts. What is the specific, objective situation? (e.g., 'The last three times we planned to meet, you cancelled on the day.')"
E - Express: "Clearly state your feelings using 'I-statements'. (e.g., 'I feel frustrated and a bit hurt when this happens.')"
A - Assert: "Clearly state what you need or want. Be direct. (e.g., 'I would like us to find a way to make our plans more reliable...')"
R - Reinforce: "Explain the positive outcome if your request is met. (e.g., 'It would help me feel more secure in our friendship...')"
M - (Stay) Mindful: "Keep your focus on your goal. Avoid getting sidetracked... You can use the 'Broken Record' technique if needed." (See Interventions: Assertiveness Skills Training & Practice - "Broken Record" Technique)
A - Appear Confident: "Use a confident tone and body language, even if you feel nervous. Maintain eye contact."
N - Negotiate: "Be willing to listen and find a workable compromise, but don't give up on your core need."
C. Internal Family Systems (IFS) Informed Approaches
1. Acknowledging an Emotional Part (General IFS Introduction)
Internal Family Systems (IFS)
What: The IFS model suggests our minds are made up of multiple "parts," each with its own feelings, beliefs, and roles. Recognizing these as "parts" helps create distance and allows for a compassionate, curious relationship with our inner world. Protectors include Managers (proactive control) and Firefighters (reactive, intense). Exiles carry burdens.
When: Internal conflict; strong self-criticism ("Inner Critic"); sudden, intense emotional shifts; feeling "stuck"; ambivalence/resistance; identifying protectors or vulnerable feelings.
General - Befriending a Part:
"It sounds like there's a part of you that feels very [name the emotion, e.g., 'angry,' 'scared']. Can we get curious about it?"
"Where do you feel that part in your body?"
"What does this part want you to know? What is it afraid would happen if it didn't feel/act this way?"
"How do you (from your calm, compassionate self) feel towards this part? Can we offer it some understanding?"
2. Acknowledging the Protector (Managers & Firefighters)
Internal Family Systems (IFS)
What: Recognizing parts whose job is to keep us safe, either by controlling things (Managers) or reacting intensely (Firefighters). They often appear as resistance, anger, anxiety, perfectionism, shutting down, or numbing behaviors.
When: (Covered by general IFS "When to Consider It")

"It sounds like a protective part of you is very active right now, maybe trying to keep you from feeling overwhelmed or getting hurt. Can we thank it for its hard work?"
"What is this protective part afraid would happen if it stepped back or let you feel what's underneath?"
(For Managers): "This part seems very responsible and wants to keep things under control. Does it feel like it's working overtime?"
(For Firefighters): "This part seems to jump in really quickly and strongly when things get tough. What feeling is it trying so hard to put out or help you escape from?"
"Let this part know you see it, you appreciate its intention (to protect you), and you want to understand its concerns. We don't need it to change right now, just to be heard."

3. Externalize the Inner Critic (Often a Manager or an Internalized Voice)
Internal Family Systems (IFS)
What: A part that uses harsh judgment, often believing it's motivating or protecting you from external criticism/failure.
When: Strong self-criticism, shame, low self-esteem.
"That critical voice sounds very loud. Can you imagine what that part looks like?"
"Let's try talking to it, not from it."
"Ask it: 'What are you trying to achieve for me by being so critical?'"
"Does this critical voice sound like anyone you know or knew?"
"Can we ask this part if it would be willing to soften its tone just a little, so we can hear its concerns without the harshness?"

4. Approaching Exiles (Vulnerable Parts) - With Caution & Within Scope
Internal Family Systems (IFS)
What: Exiles are parts that carry burdens of past pain, trauma, or difficult emotions. Approaching them requires significant safety, therapist skill, and client readiness.
When: Within a coaching context, direct work with Exiles is generally outside of scope and should be handled by the primary therapist. Coaches can help clients identify when vulnerable feelings are present and support them in using grounding/self-soothing skills, then encourage discussion with their therapist.
Why: In coaching, the aim is to increase awareness of vulnerable parts and provide immediate soothing/grounding, while reinforcing the importance of deeper therapeutic work for healing exiles.
Focus on Awareness & Support:
"It sounds like a very young or vulnerable part of you might be feeling [emotion, e.g., 'scared,' 'sad,' 'alone'] right now. Can we just acknowledge that feeling is there?"
"What does that vulnerable part need right now to feel a little bit safer or more comforted? Perhaps one of our grounding exercises or a self-soothing action?" (Link to Interventions: Simple Somatic Anchors or Interventions: Brief Self-Soothing Touch Invitation)
"These deep feelings are really important. This sounds like something valuable to explore further with your therapist, who can help you understand and heal this part more fully."

D. Somatic & Grounding Techniques
1. Simple Somatic Anchors
What: Immediate ways to connect with the present moment using bodily sensations. These anchors signal safety to the nervous system and pull your attention out of overwhelming internal states into the safety of the immediate environment. 
When: Feeling disconnected, overwhelmed, anxious, or needing to ground in the present. 
Noticing Feet on Floor:
"Right now, wherever you are, just bring your attention down to your feet. Can you feel them on the floor...? Notice the sensation of contact... Just let your feet connect you to the ground..."
Butterfly Tapping (Butterfly Hug):
"Here's a simple way to offer yourself some comfort, it's called the Butterfly Hug... cross your arms over your chest... Now, start gently tapping your hands, one after the other, in a slow, rhythmic way... As you do this, just notice the sensation..."
Hand on Heart (or other comforting place):
"If it feels comfortable... you might try placing a hand gently on your heart, or perhaps on your belly... Just notice the warmth... Notice your breath moving under your hand." (See also Interventions: Brief Self-Soothing Touch Invitation)
Simple Breath Awareness:
"Let's just bring your attention to your breath, wherever you feel it most easily in your body... There's no need to change your breathing in any way, just notice it coming in... and notice it going out." (Related to Interventions: TIPP Skill - Paced Breathing)
Pressing Fingertips Together:
"Try gently pressing the tips of your fingers on one hand against the tips of your fingers on the other. Just notice the sensation of that contact. You can do this very discreetly."


2. Mindful Body Scan
Mindfulness-based
What: A technique involving bringing non-judgmental awareness to sensations throughout the body, part by part.
When: To increase body awareness, promote relaxation, ground in the present, manage chronic pain (adapted).
 
"We can try a Mindful Body Scan. This involves bringing gentle, curious attention to different parts of your body, just noticing any sensations without trying to change them. Would you be open to that?"
"Find a comfortable position... Let's start by bringing your attention to your feet... Just notice any sensations there – warmth, coolness, pressure, tingling... Now slowly move your attention up to your ankles... your lower legs..." (Continue guiding through body parts).
"If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the part of the body we're focusing on."
(For Chronic Pain adaptation): "If you're open to it, we could try a gentle Body Scan, but with a focus on 'breathing into' areas of discomfort with kindness, or noticing areas that don't hurt, rather than trying to change anything."


4. Orienting
Somatic, Trauma-informed
What: Actively noticing and engaging with the immediate environment through the senses to establish safety and presence.
When: Dissociation, flashbacks, depersonalization/derealization, high anxiety.

"Let's remind yourself of a few key things to help you connect to the present. Can you say this out loud, or to yourself: 'I am [Your Name]. Today is,, [Year]. The time is approximately. I am in [Your current location, e.g., 'my bedroom at home']. I am safe right now'."
"Focus on my voice. My name is [Your Name], and I'm here with you on this call."
"Let's try to connect with your senses. What's one thing you can see clearly right now? Describe it to me."
"What's one thing you can physically feel? Maybe the texture of your clothes or the chair you're sitting on?"
Illustrated in Scenarios:
DID/Depersonalization
Trauma Reaction / Flashback
(Referenced in Orange Zone summary table for Disoriented/Delusional and Flashback/Dissociati
E. Polyvagal-Informed Techniques
1. The "Voo" Sound for Physiological Calming
Polyvagal-Informed, Somatic
What: Making a low, vibrating "Voo" sound on the exhale to stimulate the vagus nerve and promote parasympathetic (calming) activation.
When: Anxiety, feeling "revved up," needing to settle the nervous system.
Why: Stimulates the vagus nerve through resonant vibrations, activating the parasympathetic (calming) branch of the nervous system.

"Let's try a simple sound that can help to calm your nervous system. It's sometimes called the 'Voo' sound, and the vibration it creates can be very soothing. Would you be willing to try it with me for a few breaths?"
"First, just take a comfortable, easy breath in through your nose, letting your belly expand a little."
"Now, as you breathe out slowly and fully, I want you to make a low, gentle, vibrating 'Voooooooooo' sound. Imagine the sound of a distant foghorn, or a low hum. Let the sound be long and smooth, and try to feel the vibration in your chest and throat."


2. Brief Self-Soothing Touch Invitation
Somatic / Polyvagal-Informed
What: Gentle, self-administered touch to signal safety and comfort to the nervous system.
When: Distress, unease, needing grounding, comfort, or self-compassion.

"Sometimes, when we're feeling distressed or uneasy, a little bit of gentle, comforting touch can make a difference in how our nervous system feels. This is about offering some soothing to yourself."
"If it feels okay and right for you in this moment, you could try one of these simple things:"
"You might gently place a hand over your heart. Just let it rest there and feel its warmth and gentle pressure." (See also Interventions: Simple Somatic Anchors - Hand on Heart)
"Or, you could try slowly and gently stroking one of your arms, from shoulder to wrist, as if you were comforting a friend."
"Another option is to simply hold one of your hands with the other..."
"You could also gently cup your face in your hands for a moment."
"As you do this, just notice what that sensation of touch feels like... Does it bring any sense of comfort...?"


F. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Informed Approaches
1. ACT Defusion: Distancing from Thoughts (thought labeling?)
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
What: Techniques to change the way we relate to thoughts, rather than changing their content, to reduce their power and believability.
When: When fused with unhelpful thoughts; when thoughts are treated as literal truths or commands; to increase psychological flexibility.
Why: To see thoughts as just thoughts, so they have less influence over actions, allowing for more value-driven behavior.

"Cognitive defusion techniques from ACT are designed to change the way we relate to our thoughts... Diffusion helps create distance, allowing us to see thoughts as just what they are: words, images, or mental events..."
What: Techniques to change the way we relate to thoughts, rather than changing their content, to reduce their power and believability. 
When to Consider: When fused with unhelpful thoughts; when thoughts are treated as literal truths or commands; to increase psychological flexibility. 
Advanced Scripting & Application: "When a difficult thought gets sticky, let's try adding a phrase: 'I'm having the thought that...' So, 'I'm a failure' becomes 'I'm having the thought that I'm a failure.' Notice if that creates any space between you and the thought." 
Core Rationale: Defusion helps you see thoughts as just mental events, not commands or facts. This reduces their influence over your actions and allows for more value-driven behavior. 
Specific Defusion Techniques:
"I'm having the thought that..." Technique:
"When a difficult or unhelpful thought gets really sticky... try adding this little phrase at the beginning: 'I'm having the thought that... [client's difficult thought].'"
"So, instead of just, 'I'm a failure,' it becomes, 'I'm having the thought that I'm a failure.'"
"Try saying that to yourself a few times... What do you notice...?"
Thanking Your Mind:
"Another way to get some distance is to acknowledge the thought and then gently thank your mind for offering it up... For example, if the thought 'This is too hard' comes up, you could say to your mind, 'Thanks, mind, for that really interesting... thought!...'"
Naming the Story or Process:
"Sometimes our minds tell us stories. When you notice that familiar thought pattern starting up, you could say to yourself, 'Ah, there's the 'not good enough' story again,' or 'My mind is doing its catastrophizing thing right now.'"
Silly Voice / Singing the Thought:
"Sometimes taking a really powerful negative thought and saying it repeatedly in a silly voice... or singing it to the tune of 'Happy Birthday,' can help strip away its seriousness..."

2. Values Clarification & Committed Action
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
What: Identifying core values and exploring small, concrete actions aligned with those values, even with difficult thoughts/feelings present.
When: Feeling "stuck" or directionless; hopelessness; personal development; decision-making; needing purpose.

Explore Values: "When things feel confusing or stuck, sometimes connecting with what truly matters can be like finding a compass. If you think about the kind of person you want to be... what qualities or principles are most important? (e.g., Kindness, Courage, Connection, Growth...)."
Prioritize: "Of those values, which 1-3 feel most important or relevant to you right now?"
Assess Alignment: "Looking at your current life... how much are you living in line with that value of [Chosen Value]?"
Brainstorm Committed Actions: "Even with all the challenges... what's one small step you could take this week that would move you even 1% closer to living by that value of [Chosen Value]?"
Example: (As in original text)
Set an Intention: "Would you be willing to commit to taking that one small step this week?"

G. Cognitive & Reframing Techniques
1. Cognitive Flexibility & Reframing (General)
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) informed, General Cognitive Skills
What: Practicing looking at situations, thoughts, or beliefs from different angles to find more helpful ways to understand them.
When: When thoughts feel heavy or limiting; to lighten emotional load or open new possibilities.

"Sometimes our thoughts can get us stuck in one way of seeing things... Cognitive flexibility is about practicing looking at situations... from different angles. Reframing helps us find new or more helpful ways to understand... Are you open to trying...?"
Rapid Reframe / Alternative Explanations:
"Let's switch lenses for a moment: If this situation wasn't a total failure, what else could it be? A learning opportunity? A misunderstanding?..."
"I hear that your current view is that [client's current negative interpretation]... Let's try an experiment... what are some other possible ways to see this situation?..."
(Provide examples as in original text regarding test failure or friend not calling back.)

2. Enhanced Cognitive Reframes (Adding Specific Patterns)
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) informed, Shame-focused
What: Addresses deeper, often shame-based or identity-level thought patterns, focusing on separating self-worth from behaviors or external events.
When: Deep shame/self-blame; equating behavior with being a "bad person"; feeling worthless after betrayal; when general reframing isn't reaching core self-critical narratives.

"Sometimes our thoughts about ourselves, especially after difficult experiences, can become very harsh... Would you be open to looking at some of those really tough thoughts from a different angle?"
Reframe: Behavior vs. Identity:
When to use: Client says "I am a failure," "I am bad" based on a specific action.
"I hear you saying you feel like [e.g., 'a failure'] because [specific behavior/event]... Let's try to look at this from a different perspective. There's a big difference between making a mistake and being a mistake... 'Behavior is feedback, not a moral failing... Shame says you are the mistake. Accountability says you made a mistake-and gives you a way forward'."
"How does it feel to consider that this was something you did, rather than something you are?"
What: A technique to challenge global, negative self-labels by reframing them as specific, isolated behaviors. 
When to Consider: When a client makes an identity-level statement like "I'm a failure" or "I'm useless." 
Core Rationale: This shift separates a person's inherent worth from their actions. It makes the problem feel more manageable and less like a fundamental flaw, opening the door to learning and growth. 
"I hear you saying 'I'm a failure.' Let's reframe that. Is it more accurate to say 'I made a mistake'? There's a big difference between being a failure and doing something that didn't work out. One is a temporary action; the other is a permanent label." 
Reframe: Betrayal & Self-Worth:
When to use: Client feels devalued/responsible after being betrayed.
"It's incredibly painful to be betrayed... Let's consider another way to look at this. When someone betrays trust, it reveals something about their choices and integrity, not necessarily about your value... 'Their choice shows their integrity, not your worth. Betrayal signals where a line is needed, not where you failed. Let's shift from why they did it to what you need now'."
"How does it land for you to think that their actions reflect on them, rather than defining you?"
General Probes: "What changes... when you consider this alternative perspective?" "If this new thought were true, how might that affect how you feel...?"

3. Externalizing the Inner Crittic (Narrative-therapy)
What: A technique to separate a person from their problem by giving the problem (like an inner critic) a name and identity. 
When to Consider: When a client is over-identifying with a problem, e.g., "I am anxiety" or "I am a failure." 
"It sounds like 'The Critic' is really loud today. What is it telling you? By thinking of it as 'The Critic' instead of 'me,' we can get some distance and see that you are not the problem; the problem is the problem." 
Core Rationale: Externalizing creates space to examine the problem's influence on your life, question its authority, and rewrite your relationship with it, reclaiming your own identity and agency. 

4. Benefit Finding / Silver Linings
Primary Modality/Approach: Positive Psychology, Cognitive Reframing
What: Identifying positive outcomes or learnings from adverse experiences.
When: After difficult situations, to build resilience, shift perspective (use with caution and empathy, especially with significant loss or trauma).
"When things are really difficult... it's natural to focus on what went wrong... Sometimes, though, even in tough situations, there can be unexpected positives, learning, or 'silver linings,' however small. Looking back at [the difficult situation], is there anything at all you learned from it? Anything that, surprisingly, might have strengthened you...?"
"This isn't about pretending the hard stuff isn't hard, but just seeing if there's another layer to it."

5. Zooming Out / Bigger Picture
Primary Modality/Approach: Cognitive Reframing
What: Shifting perspective by considering an issue in a broader context (time, scope).
When: When an issue feels all-consuming or overwhelming.
"Right now, this [issue/feeling] feels huge and all-consuming... Let's try 'zooming out' for a moment, like using a camera lens."
"If you think about this specific issue in the context of your entire week, how big is it? Now, what about in the context of your entire month, or your entire year? Or even your whole life?"
"Sometimes, seeing it as one part of a much bigger picture can help shift its weight or intensity a little..."



6. Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Thought
Primary Modality/Approach: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) informed
What: Examining the advantages and disadvantages of holding onto a specific thought.
When: When a client is strongly fused with a thought that seems unhelpful or distressing.

"That thought you're having - [restate the specific thought] - it sounds like it's very strong for you right now."
"Let's explore this thought a bit. What does holding onto this thought do for you? In what ways might it be helpful or protective...?"
"And what are the costs of holding onto this thought so tightly? What does it prevent you from doing or feeling...?"
"Looking at both sides, is this thought serving you well right now, or is it perhaps getting in your way more than it's helping?"


7. Thought Challenging - cognitive restructuring
Primary Modality/Approach: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
What: Examining the evidence for and against automatic negative thoughts and considering alternative, more balanced perspectives.
When: Stuck/Negative Thought Loop / Rumination (as an alternative/complement to defusion); Acute Anxiety/Panic (once calmed); Hopelessness / Despair (to challenge global negative beliefs).
Identify the Hot Thought: "When you felt [the strong emotion], what specific thought was going through your mind right then? Let's try to pinpoint that 'hot thought.'"
Examine the Evidence For: "Okay, so the thought is ''. What evidence or experiences make you believe this thought is true?"
Examine the Evidence Against: "Now, let's play detective a bit. What evidence or experiences might suggest this thought isn't 100% true, or that there might be another way to look at it? Have there been times when this thought wasn't true?"
Consider Alternatives (Reframing link): "If that thought isn't completely true, what's a more balanced or alternative way to think about this situation? What might someone else say?" (See Interventions: Cognitive Flexibility & Reframing)
Assess the Impact: "What happens when you believe that hot thought so strongly? How does it affect your feelings and actions? And what might happen if you could hold onto this more balanced thought instead? How would that change things?"
Disclaimer: "This isn't about pretending negative thoughts don't exist, but about checking if they're giving us the whole picture..."



H. Motivational & Solution-Focused Approaches
1. Motivational Interviewing (MI)
What: A collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change, designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person’s own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.
When: Ambivalence about change; low motivation; program resistance; exploring readiness for behavior change (e.g., substance use, health behaviors).
"Sometimes when we think about making changes, there can be a part of us that wants to, and another part that feels hesitant or isn't sure. That's completely normal. My role here isn't to convince you of anything, but to help you explore your own thoughts and feelings about this..."
Specific MI Techniques:
Responding to DARN/CAT Change Talk:
"When you talk about wanting to change, I'm listening for certain kinds of 'change talk' - words that show your Desire, Ability, Reasons, or Need to change (DARN), and also your Commitment, Activation, or Taking Steps (CAT)..."
(Provide examples for Desire, Ability, Reasons, Need, Commitment, Activation, Taking Steps as in original text.)
Developing Discrepancy:
"Sometimes, looking at where we are now versus where we want to be, or how our current actions line up with our deeper values, can give us clarity..."
"You mentioned earlier that [client's value/goal]... and I'm also hearing that [current behavior]... How do those two things fit together for you right now?"
Importance and Confidence Rulers:
"Sometimes it's helpful to get a sense of how important a change is to you, and how confident you feel in making it. We can use a scale from 0 to 10."
(Provide prompts for Importance and Confidence scales as in original text, including "why not a lower number?" and "what might get you to a higher number?")
Strategic Summaries:
"Let me pause for a moment and see if I'm understanding what you've shared so far, especially the parts about why you might want to make a change and how you might do it."
(Provide example summary structure as in original text.)
Responding to Sustain Talk (Reasons for not changing):
"It's just as important to understand the reasons for things staying the same... My role isn't to argue against those, but to hear them."

2. Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) Techniques
Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT)
What: A future-focused, goal-directed approach that highlights client strengths and resources to help them find solutions rather than dwelling on problems.
When: When clients feel stuck, hopeless, or problem-saturated; to build on existing strengths and past successes; to clarify desired futures.
"Sometimes when we're facing challenges, it can be really helpful to focus on what solutions might look like, what's already working (even a little bit), and what your hopes are for the future, rather than getting too stuck in the problem itself..."
Specific SFBT Techniques:
Scaling Questions:
"Using a scale can help us get a clearer picture of where things are now and what small improvements might look like."
"On a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 means [problem solved/goal achieved]... where would you say you are today?"
"What tells you that you're at a [client's number] and not a [lower number]?... What are you already doing...?"
"What would a [client's number + 0.5 or +1] look like? What would be different...?"
Coping Questions:
"When things are really tough, it's amazing how people still manage to get through. I'm curious about how you've been doing that."
"Given everything you've been dealing with... How have you managed to keep going?"
"What have you been doing to prevent things from getting even worse?"
Detailed Miracle Question Variations:
"Let's try a little thought experiment... Imagine tonight while you're asleep, a miracle happens, and the problem... is completely solved... When you wake up tomorrow morning, what would be the very first small thing you would notice...?"
"What would [someone close to you] notice different about you if this miracle happened...?"
Relationship Questions:
"Sometimes, the people around us notice changes... If you were to make a small step towards [your goal], who in your life would be the first person to notice?..."
"What Else?" and "How?" Questions:
"These simple questions can help us uncover more details about your successes, strengths, and preferred future."
"What else?" (after identifying a strength, solution, progress)
"How?" (to understand the process of success)

What: A communication framework focusing on expressing oneself honestly and receiving others empathically by concentrating on Observations, Feelings, Needs, and Requests.
When: Struggling to identify/express needs; enmeshed relationships; manipulative interactions (as an internal guide); general conflict resolution/communication improvement.
Introduction: "It sounds like understanding what you needed and asking for it was really tough... Have you ever heard of Nonviolent Communication, or NVC? It looks at four key pieces: what we Observe, what we Feel, what we Need, and what we Request..."
Observation (Facts, not Judgments): "Let's start with just the facts... what did you see or hear, like a camera recording it, without adding any interpretation or judgment?..."
Feeling (Emotions, not Thoughts): "When you observed [the observation], what specific feeling came up for you? Try to use an emotion word..."
Need (Universal Human Needs): "Feelings often point to unmet needs. What universal need wasn't being met for you...? Was it a need for respect? Understanding? Connection?..."
Request (Specific, Actionable, Positive): "Knowing what you observed, felt, and needed, what's one specific, doable thing you could have requested...?"
Practice: "Let's try putting it together... 'When I saw/heard [Observation], I felt [Feeling], because I needed [Need]. Would you be willing to?'..."

Connect to Feelings: "You mentioned feeling [resentful/exhausted/guilty]. Often, these feelings can be signals that a boundary might need to be set..."
Practice Simple "No" Statements (Gently): "Saying 'no' can be really hard. Let's practice some gentle but clear ways to do it... How might it feel to say: 'I need some time to think about that...' / 'Thank you for asking, but I won't be able to do that right now.'..."
Acknowledge Guilt/Fear: "It's really common to feel guilty/afraid when we first start setting boundaries... That doesn't mean it's wrong to set them..."

Define Assertiveness: "Let's talk about communication styles. Sometimes we can be passive... aggressive... /assertive... Assertiveness is about finding that middle ground..."
Identify Rights: "It can help to remember our 'Assertive Rights,' like the right to say no without guilt... Which of these feels hardest for you to claim?"
"Broken Record" Technique: "When someone keeps pushing, a technique called 'Broken Record' can help. You calmly and clearly repeat your point or boundary... For example, 'I understand, but I won't be able to help with that today.'..." (Used in Interventions: DEAR MAN)
Role-Playing: "It can be really helpful to practice these conversations. Would you be willing to try a role-play?..."
Start Small: "Practicing assertiveness can feel scary. What's one very small, low-stakes situation where you could try being just a little bit more assertive this week?"

"Shame can be such a powerful and isolating feeling... These tools are about gently reducing the intensity of shame... and helping you reconnect with your inherent self-worth..."
Normalize: "It makes so much sense that you're feeling this shame... So many people experience deep shame when [similar situation]... It's a really common, though painful, human emotion."
Invite (a shift in perspective /self-compassion): "I wonder, if someone you cared about was feeling this exact same shame, what might you say to them?..." / "Shame often comes with a very harsh inner critic. If you could ask that critical voice to just step aside for a moment, what might a more compassionate or understanding part of you say...?" (See Interventions: Self-Compassion Break (Kristin Neff) and Interventions: Externalize the Inner Critic - IFS)
Re-anchor (to present reality, strengths, or values): "Okay, that shame is a feeling... And right here, right now... you are [mention a present reality, e.g., 'safe']... Can you let that truth be here alongside the shame?" / "Even with this feeling of shame, what's one small thing that is still true about you—a strength you have, a value you hold...?"

When: Feeling "Stuck"/Directionless; Hopelessness/Despair; Toxic situations one cannot immediately leave; High anxiety/worry about external events.
 
Introduce the Concept: "It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough situation where a lot feels out of your hands... Sometimes it can help to map out what we can and can't control. Can we try drawing three concentric circles?"
The Inner Circle (Control): "In the very middle, let's list the things you have direct control over. These are usually your own thoughts, your attitudes, your choices, your actions, your responses..."
The Middle Circle (Influence): "In the next circle out, let's put things you don't control, but you might be able to influence. This could be how others respond to you... your relationships..."

   Skill-Building, Psychoeducation
What: Helping clients identify existing coping strategies and brainstorm/plan new ones for various situations.
When: When clients need to expand their repertoire of coping mechanisms for stress, difficult emotions, or challenging situations.
 
Introduce: "Sometimes it's helpful to think about having a 'toolbox' of different coping strategies for different situations. Would you be open to exploring what tools are already in your toolbox and maybe adding some new ones?"
Explore Existing Strategies: "What are some things you currently do... that help you manage when you feel [specific emotion/stressor]?" / "What has helped you get through tough moments in the past?"
Categorize & Brainstorm New Options: (Using categories like Sensory Grounding, Movement, Creative Expression, Social Connection, Cognitive/Mind Activities, Relaxation Techniques, Self-Care Basics, Nature, as detailed in the original text.)
Example (Sensory Grounding): "Let's think about your senses. Are there particular sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or textures that you find calming or grounding?"
Plan for Implementation: "Of these ideas... which one or two feel most manageable for you to try?" / "When is a specific time you could practice [chosen strategy]?" / "What might get in the way... and how could you plan for that?"

   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) informed, Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) Lite
What: Tools to reduce distress from recurring nightmares and gentle rescripting. Not a trauma processing technique.
When: Distressing, recurring nightmares; fear of falling asleep due to nightmares. (Refer to trauma therapist if clearly trauma-linked).
Normalize & Validate: "Nightmares can be incredibly upsetting... Many people experience this, and we can explore some ways to make them feel less powerful."
Pre-Sleep Routine & Intent: "Sometimes a calming pre-sleep routine can help... What's one small thing you could do before bed to feel more relaxed...?"
Post-Nightmare Grounding: "If you wake up from a nightmare, the first step is to remind yourself you're safe now. Use some of those somatic anchors..." (See Interventions: Simple Somatic Anchors)
Rescripting Lite (Focus on Mastery/Safety): "Think about one of those recurring nightmares... if you were the director of that dream 'movie,' how could you change the ending, even slightly, to make it feel a bit safer or give yourself more power?..."
Dream Journaling (Optional/Careful): "Some people find it helpful to write down their nightmares... to get them out of their head..."
Emphasize Referral: "While these tools can help... if these nightmares are deeply tied to past difficult experiences, working with your therapist... will be really important."
Illustrated in Scenarios: (This is a specific intervention for nightmare-related distress.)

2. DID/Depersonalization Techniques
   Grounding, Reality Testing, Trauma-informed
What: Targeted techniques to help clients re-anchor to the present moment and their sense of self during dissociative symptoms.
When: Client reports feeling "unreal," "detached," "foggy," or like the world isn't real; during/after trauma reaction/flashback; signs of dissociation (blank stare, delayed responses).
 
Normalize Gently & Validate Distress: "It sounds like you're having that really unsettling feeling of things not being quite real... We can try a couple of things to help you feel more anchored..."
Verbalizing Actions (for Depersonalization): "If you feel unreal, sometimes it helps to bring your actions into sharp focus. Try describing each small step of what you're doing out loud. For example... 'I am feeling my feet on the floor...'"
Orienting to Self, Place, Time & Safety (for Derealization/General Dissociation): "Let's remind yourself of a few key things... 'I am [Your Name]. Today is... I am in [Your current location]... I am safe right now'." (See Interventions: Orienting)
Sensory Anchoring (if more support needed): "Let's try to connect with your senses. What's one thing you can see clearly right now? Describe it to me." (See Interventions: Grounding Through Senses)

When: Client off-topic/distracted; stuck in negative thought loop/rumination; spiraling; lost in excessive details; limited session time.
Acknowledge and Validate Current Focus First: "I hear that [current topic/point] is important to you..."
State the Intention/Rationale for Redirecting: "...and for our brief time together... let's gently bring the focus back to [intended topic/feeling] for now."
Specific Redirection Prompts:
To Core Issue/Goal: "How does [off-topic point] connect to your immediate need for [stability/support] right now?"
From Circling/Repetition: "Noticing we're circling this point... What's the core feeling /unmet need driving that loop?"
From Details/Story to Feeling/Need: "The details... sound significant... Let's pause the narrative... and check in with the feeling underneath..."
From Problem Focus to Action/Coping/Strengths: "Understanding the problem... is important... Let's pivot slightly now towards resources and what helps you cope."
Using Time Limits: "We have [x] minutes left. Let's focus our time on what will help most right now."
Offering Choice: "Would you prefer to talk a bit more about [current topic], or would it be more helpful to focus on [coping strategy/different topic]...?"
Illustrated in Scenarios:
Off-Topic or Distracted
Manipulative Interactions (to maintain focus on client agency)

M. Psychoeducation: Simple Explanations for Common Concepts
What: Providing clear, simple information about psychological concepts, how minds/bodies work, and common challenges to empower clients with understanding.
When: Client confusion about reactions ("Why do I do that?"); harsh self-criticism for normal responses; introducing a new skill; helping understand patterns (anxiety, stress). Always offer as an invitation.
"Would it be helpful to talk a bit about what happens in our brains when we feel stressed?"
1. The Stress Response: Fight, Flight, & Freeze
Explanation: "Think of your brain like it has an ancient alarm system... When this alarm (amygdala) senses a threat... it can instantly trigger a 'code red.'... floods your body with adrenaline and cortisol, getting you ready to either Fight... Flee... or... Freeze... happens before your thinking brain has a chance to catch up."
Why it Helps: Normalizes intense physical reactions to stress; explains why "thinking your way out" is hard; highlights need for calming body first.
Links To: Acute Anxiety or Panic, Highly Agitated, Trauma Reaction, Shut Down. (Consider linking to Interventions: TIPP Skill, Simple Somatic Anchors)
2. The Window of Tolerance
Explanation: "Imagine your nervous system has a 'Window of Tolerance'—an optimal zone where you can think clearly, manage emotions... When stress gets too high, you might get pushed above... into 'hyper-arousal' (anxious, overwhelmed)... or drop below... into 'hypo-arousal' (numb, shut down)... The goal... is to recognize when you're outside it and use tools to gently guide yourself back inside."
Why it Helps: Visual model for self-awareness; normalizes "revved up" and "shut down" states; rationale for regulation skills.
Links To: Emotionally Flooded, Highly Agitated, Shut Down, Acute Anxiety. (Consider linking to grounding/regulation skills in Interventions)
Illustrated in Scenarios:
Chaotic / Multiple States (Window of Tolerance Check)
3. Flipping Your Lid (Hand Model of the Brain)
Explanation: (Visual with hand) "Imagine your hand is your brain. Wrist/palm = brainstem. Thumb tucked in = limbic system (emotions, alarm). Fingers curled over = prefrontal cortex (thinking, planning)... When alarm goes off strongly (thumb pops up), your 'thinking brain' can go 'offline' (fingers 'flip up')... 'flipping your lid.'..."
Why it Helps: Simple visual; de-stigmatizes "irrational" reactions; explains communication breakdown; reinforces need for calming before problem-solving.
Links To: Highly Agitated, Emotionally Flooded, Acute Anxiety, Manipulative Interactions (understanding reactivity).
4. Thoughts Aren't Facts (Intro to Cognitive Distortions)
Explanation: "Our minds are thought-generating machines... But just because we have a thought doesn't make it 100% true or helpful. Sometimes, our minds take mental shortcuts... 'cognitive distortions'... Examples might be 'Black-and-White Thinking,' 'Catastrophizing,' or 'Mind Reading.' Just noticing these patterns... 'Oh, that's a thought, not a fact,' is the first step."
Why it Helps: Introduces cognitive awareness; creates distance from negative thoughts; opens door to questioning/reframing.
Links To: Stuck/ Negative Thought Loop, Thought Challenging, ACT Defusion, Cognitive Flexibility & Reframing.
5. Emotions as Messengers
Explanation: "We often label emotions as 'good' or 'bad,' but it can be more helpful to think of them as messengers or signals... giving us information... For example, anxiety might be signaling a potential threat... Sadness might signal a loss... If we can listen to the message underneath... we can better understand our needs..."
Why it Helps: Reduces judgment around "negative" emotions; encourages curiosity; links feelings to underlying needs.
